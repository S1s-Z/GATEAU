Get funded by\nY Combinator.\n\n\n\n\nJuly 2004(This essay is derived from a talk at Oscon 2004.)\nA few months ago I finished a new \nbook, \nand in reviews I keep\nnoticing words like \"provocative'' and \"controversial.'' To say\nnothing of \"idiotic.''I didn't mean to make the book controversial.  I was trying to make\nit efficient.  I didn't want to waste people's time telling them\nthings they already knew.  It's more efficient just to give them\nthe diffs.  But I suppose that's bound to yield an alarming book.EdisonsThere's no controversy about which idea is most controversial:\nthe suggestion that variation in wealth might not be as big a\nproblem as we think.I didn't say in the book that variation in wealth was in itself a\ngood thing.  I said in some situations it might be a sign of good\nthings.  A throbbing headache is not a good thing, but it can be\na sign of a good thing-- for example, that you're recovering\nconsciousness after being hit on the head.Variation in wealth can be a sign of variation in productivity.\n(In a society of one, they're identical.) And that\nis almost certainly a good thing: if your society has no variation\nin productivity, it's probably not because everyone is Thomas\nEdison.  It's probably because you have no Thomas Edisons.In a low-tech society you don't see much variation in productivity.\nIf you have a tribe of nomads collecting sticks for a fire, how\nmuch more productive is the best stick gatherer going to be than\nthe worst?  A factor of two?  Whereas when you hand people a complex tool\nlike a computer, the variation in what they can do with\nit is enormous.That's not a new idea.  Fred Brooks wrote about it in 1974, and\nthe study he quoted was published in 1968.  But I think he\nunderestimated the variation between programmers.  He wrote about productivity in lines\nof code:  the best programmers can solve a given problem in a tenth\nthe time.  But what if the problem isn't given? In programming, as\nin many fields, the hard part isn't solving problems, but deciding\nwhat problems to solve.  Imagination is hard to measure, but\nin practice it dominates the kind of productivity that's measured\nin lines of code.Productivity varies in any field, but there are few in which it\nvaries so much.  The variation between programmers\nis so great that it becomes a difference in kind.  I don't\nthink this is something intrinsic to programming, though.  In every field,\ntechnology magnifies differences in productivity.  I think what's\nhappening in programming is just that we have a lot of technological\nleverage.  But in every field the lever is getting longer, so the\nvariation we see is something that more and more fields will see\nas time goes on.  And the success of companies, and countries, will\ndepend increasingly on how they deal with it.If variation in productivity increases with technology, then the\ncontribution of the most productive individuals will not only be\ndisproportionately large, but will actually grow with time.  When\nyou reach the point where 90% of a group's output is created by 1%\nof its members, you lose big if something (whether Viking raids,\nor central planning) drags their productivity down to the average.If we want to get the most out of them, we need to understand these\nespecially productive people.  What motivates them?  What do they\nneed to do their jobs?  How do you recognize them? How do you\nget them to come and work for you?  And then of course there's the\nquestion, how do you become one?More than MoneyI know a handful of super-hackers, so I sat down and thought about\nwhat they have in common.  Their defining quality is probably that\nthey really love to program.  Ordinary programmers write code to pay\nthe bills.  Great hackers think of it as something they do for fun,\nand which they're delighted to find people will pay them for.Great programmers are sometimes said to be indifferent to money.\nThis isn't quite true.  It is true that all they really care about\nis doing interesting work.  But if you make enough money, you get\nto work on whatever you want, and for that reason hackers are\nattracted by the idea of making really large amounts of money.\nBut as long as they still have to show up for work every day, they\ncare more about what they do there than how much they get paid for\nit.Economically, this is a fact of the greatest importance, because\nit means you don't have to pay great hackers anything like what\nthey're worth.  A great programmer might be ten or a hundred times\nas productive as an ordinary one, but he'll consider himself lucky\nto get paid three times as much.  As I'll explain later, this is\npartly because great hackers don't know how good they are.  But\nit's also because money is not the main thing they want.What do hackers want?  Like all craftsmen, hackers like good tools.\nIn fact, that's an understatement.  Good hackers find it unbearable\nto use bad tools.  They'll simply refuse to work on projects with\nthe wrong infrastructure.At a startup I once worked for, one of the things pinned up on our\nbulletin board was an ad from IBM.  It was a picture of an AS400,\nand the headline read, I think, \"hackers despise\nit.'' [1]When you decide what infrastructure to use for a project, you're\nnot just making a technical decision.  You're also making a social\ndecision, and this may be the more important of the two.  For\nexample, if your company wants to write some software, it might\nseem a prudent choice to write it in Java.  But when you choose a\nlanguage, you're also choosing a community.  The programmers you'll\nbe able to hire to work on a Java project won't be as\nsmart as the\nones you could get to work on a project written in Python.\nAnd the quality of your hackers probably matters more than the\nlanguage you choose.  Though, frankly, the fact that good hackers\nprefer Python to Java should tell you something about the relative\nmerits of those languages.Business types prefer the most popular languages because they view\nlanguages as standards. They don't want to bet the company on\nBetamax.  The thing about languages, though, is that they're not\njust standards.  If you have to move bits over a network, by all\nmeans use TCP/IP.  But a programming language isn't just a format.\nA programming language is a medium of expression.I've read that Java has just overtaken Cobol as the most popular\nlanguage.  As a standard, you couldn't wish for more.  But as a\nmedium of expression, you could do a lot better.  Of all the great\nprogrammers I can think of, I know of only one who would voluntarily\nprogram in Java.  And of all the great programmers I can think of\nwho don't work for Sun, on Java, I know of zero.Great hackers also generally insist on using open source software.\nNot just because it's better, but because it gives them more control.\nGood hackers insist on control.  This is part of what makes them\ngood hackers:  when something's broken, they need to fix it.  You\nwant them to feel this way about the software they're writing for\nyou.  You shouldn't be surprised when they feel the same way about\nthe operating system.A couple years ago a venture capitalist friend told me about a new\nstartup he was involved with.  It sounded promising.  But the next\ntime I talked to him, he said they'd decided to build their software\non Windows NT, and had just hired a very experienced NT developer\nto be their chief technical officer.  When I heard this, I thought,\nthese guys are doomed.  One, the CTO couldn't be a first rate\nhacker, because to become an eminent NT developer he would have\nhad to use NT voluntarily, multiple times, and I couldn't imagine\na great hacker doing that; and two, even if he was good, he'd have\na hard time hiring anyone good to work for him if the project had\nto be built on NT. [2]The Final FrontierAfter software, the most important tool to a hacker is probably\nhis office.  Big companies think the function of office space is to express\nrank.  But hackers use their offices for more than that: they\nuse their office as a place to think in.  And if you're a technology\ncompany, their thoughts are your product.  So making hackers work\nin a noisy, distracting environment is like having a paint factory\nwhere the air is full of soot.The cartoon strip Dilbert has a lot to say about cubicles, and with\ngood reason.  All the hackers I know despise them.  The mere prospect\nof being interrupted is enough to prevent hackers from working on\nhard problems.  If you want to get real work done in an office with\ncubicles, you have two options: work at home, or come in early or\nlate or on a weekend, when no one else is there.  Don't companies\nrealize this is a sign that something is broken?  An office\nenvironment is supposed to be something that helps\nyou work, not something you work despite.Companies like Cisco are proud that everyone there has a cubicle,\neven the CEO.  But they're not so advanced as they think; obviously\nthey still view office space as a badge of rank.  Note too that\nCisco is famous for doing very little product development in house.\nThey get new technology by buying the startups that created it-- where\npresumably the hackers did have somewhere quiet to work.One big company that understands what hackers need is Microsoft.\nI once saw a recruiting ad for Microsoft with a big picture of a\ndoor.  Work for us, the premise was, and we'll give you a place to\nwork where you can actually get work done.   And you know, Microsoft\nis remarkable among big companies in that they are able to develop\nsoftware in house.  Not well, perhaps, but well enough.If companies want hackers to be productive, they should look at\nwhat they do at home.  At home, hackers can arrange things themselves\nso they can get the most done.  And when they work at home, hackers\ndon't work in noisy, open spaces; they work in rooms with doors.  They\nwork in cosy, neighborhoody places with people around and somewhere\nto walk when they need to mull something over, instead of in glass\nboxes set in acres of parking lots.  They have a sofa they can take\na nap on when they feel tired, instead of sitting in a coma at\ntheir desk, pretending to work.  There's no crew of people with\nvacuum cleaners that roars through every evening during the prime\nhacking hours.  There are no meetings or, God forbid, corporate\nretreats or team-building exercises.  And when you look at what\nthey're doing on that computer, you'll find it reinforces what I\nsaid earlier about tools.  They may have to use Java and Windows\nat work, but at home, where they can choose for themselves, you're\nmore likely to find them using Perl and Linux.Indeed, these statistics about Cobol or Java being the most popular\nlanguage can be misleading.  What we ought to look at, if we want\nto know what tools are best, is what hackers choose when they can\nchoose freely-- that is, in projects of their own.  When you ask\nthat question, you find that open source operating systems already\nhave a dominant market share, and the number one language is probably\nPerl.InterestingAlong with good tools, hackers want interesting projects.  What\nmakes a project interesting?  Well, obviously overtly sexy\napplications like stealth planes or special effects software would\nbe interesting to work on.  But any application can be interesting\nif it poses novel technical challenges.  So it's hard to predict\nwhich problems hackers will like, because some become\ninteresting only when the people working on them discover a new\nkind of solution.  Before ITA\n(who wrote the software inside Orbitz),\nthe people working on airline fare searches probably thought it\nwas one of the most boring applications imaginable.  But ITA made\nit interesting by \nredefining the problem in a more ambitious way.I think the same thing happened at Google.  When Google was founded,\nthe conventional wisdom among the so-called portals was that search\nwas boring and unimportant.  But the guys at Google didn't think\nsearch was boring, and that's why they do it so well.This is an area where managers can make a difference.  Like a parent\nsaying to a child, I bet you can't clean up your whole room in\nten minutes, a good manager can sometimes redefine a problem as a\nmore interesting one.  Steve Jobs seems to be particularly good at\nthis, in part simply by having high standards.  There were a lot\nof small, inexpensive computers before the Mac.  He redefined the\nproblem as: make one that's beautiful.  And that probably drove\nthe developers harder than any carrot or stick could.They certainly delivered.  When the Mac first appeared, you didn't\neven have to turn it on to know it would be good; you could tell\nfrom the case.  A few weeks ago I was walking along the street in\nCambridge, and in someone's trash I saw what appeared to be a Mac\ncarrying case.  I looked inside, and there was a Mac SE.  I carried\nit home and plugged it in, and it booted.  The happy Macintosh\nface, and then the finder.  My God, it was so simple.  It was just\nlike ... Google.Hackers like to work for people with high standards.  But it's not\nenough just to be exacting.  You have to insist on the right things.\nWhich usually means that you have to be a hacker yourself.  I've\nseen occasional articles about how to manage programmers.  Really\nthere should be two articles: one about what to do if\nyou are yourself a programmer, and one about what to do if you're not.  And the \nsecond could probably be condensed into two words:  give up.The problem is not so much the day to day management.  Really good\nhackers are practically self-managing.  The problem is, if you're\nnot a hacker, you can't tell who the good hackers are.  A similar\nproblem explains why American cars are so ugly.  I call it the\ndesign paradox.  You might think that you could make your products\nbeautiful just by hiring a great designer to design them.  But if\nyou yourself don't have good taste, \nhow are you going to recognize\na good designer?  By definition you can't tell from his portfolio.\nAnd you can't go by the awards he's won or the jobs he's had,\nbecause in design, as in most fields, those tend to be driven by\nfashion and schmoozing, with actual ability a distant third.\nThere's no way around it:  you can't manage a process intended to\nproduce beautiful things without knowing what beautiful is.  American\ncars are ugly because American car companies are run by people with\nbad taste.Many people in this country think of taste as something elusive,\nor even frivolous.  It is neither.  To drive design, a manager must\nbe the most demanding user of a company's products.  And if you\nhave really good taste, you can, as Steve Jobs does, make satisfying\nyou the kind of problem that good people like to work on.Nasty Little ProblemsIt's pretty easy to say what kinds of problems are not interesting:\nthose where instead of solving a few big, clear, problems, you have\nto solve a lot of nasty little ones.  One of the worst kinds of\nprojects is writing an interface to a piece of software that's\nfull of bugs.  Another is when you have to customize\nsomething for an individual client's complex and ill-defined needs.\nTo hackers these kinds of projects are the death of a thousand\ncuts.The distinguishing feature of nasty little problems is that you\ndon't learn anything from them.   Writing a compiler is interesting\nbecause it teaches you what a compiler is.  But writing an interface\nto a buggy piece of software doesn't teach you anything, because the\nbugs are random.  [3] So it's not just fastidiousness that makes good\nhackers avoid nasty little problems.  It's more a question of\nself-preservation.  Working on nasty little problems makes you\nstupid.  Good hackers avoid it for the same reason models avoid\ncheeseburgers.Of course some problems inherently have this character.  And because\nof supply and demand, they pay especially well.  So a company that\nfound a way to get great hackers to work on tedious problems would\nbe very successful.  How would you do it?One place this happens is in startups.  At our startup we had \nRobert Morris working as a system administrator.  That's like having the\nRolling Stones play at a bar mitzvah.  You can't hire that kind of\ntalent.  But people will do any amount of drudgery for companies\nof which they're the founders.  [4]Bigger companies solve the problem by partitioning the company.\nThey get smart people to work for them by establishing a separate\nR&D department where employees don't have to work directly on\ncustomers' nasty little problems. [5] In this model, the research\ndepartment functions like a mine. They produce new ideas; maybe\nthe rest of the company will be able to use them.You may not have to go to this extreme.  \nBottom-up programming\nsuggests another way to partition the company: have the smart people\nwork as toolmakers.  If your company makes software to do x, have\none group that builds tools for writing software of that type, and\nanother that uses these tools to write the applications.  This way\nyou might be able to get smart people to write 99% of your code,\nbut still keep them almost as insulated from users as they would\nbe in a traditional research department.  The toolmakers would have\nusers, but they'd only be the company's own developers.  [6]If Microsoft used this approach, their software wouldn't be so full\nof security holes, because the less smart people writing the actual\napplications wouldn't be doing low-level stuff like allocating\nmemory.  Instead of writing Word directly in C, they'd be plugging\ntogether big Lego blocks of Word-language.  (Duplo, I believe, is\nthe technical term.)ClumpingAlong with interesting problems, what good hackers like is other\ngood hackers.  Great hackers tend to clump together-- sometimes\nspectacularly so, as at Xerox Parc.   So you won't attract good\nhackers in linear proportion to how good an environment you create\nfor them.  The tendency to clump means it's more like the square\nof the environment.  So it's winner take all.  At any given time,\nthere are only about ten or twenty places where hackers most want to\nwork, and if you aren't one of them, you won't just have fewer\ngreat hackers, you'll have zero.Having great hackers is not, by itself, enough to make a company\nsuccessful.  It works well for Google and ITA, which are two of\nthe hot spots right now, but it didn't help Thinking Machines or\nXerox.  Sun had a good run for a while, but their business model\nis a down elevator.  In that situation, even the best hackers can't\nsave you.I think, though, that all other things being equal, a company that\ncan attract great hackers will have a huge advantage.  There are\npeople who would disagree with this.  When we were making the rounds\nof venture capital firms in the 1990s, several told us that software\ncompanies didn't win by writing great software, but through brand,\nand dominating channels, and doing the right deals.They really seemed to believe this, and I think I know why.  I\nthink what a lot of VCs are looking for, at least unconsciously,\nis the next Microsoft.  And of course if Microsoft is your model,\nyou shouldn't be looking for companies that hope to win by writing\ngreat software.  But VCs are mistaken to look for the next Microsoft,\nbecause no startup can be the next Microsoft unless some other\ncompany is prepared to bend over at just the right moment and be\nthe next IBM.It's a mistake to use Microsoft as a model, because their whole\nculture derives from that one lucky break.  Microsoft is a bad data\npoint.  If you throw them out, you find that good products do tend\nto win in the market.  What VCs should be looking for is the next\nApple, or the next Google.I think Bill Gates knows this.  What worries him about Google is\nnot the power of their brand, but the fact that they have\nbetter hackers. [7]\nRecognitionSo who are the great hackers?  How do you know when you meet one?\nThat turns out to be very hard.  Even hackers can't tell.  I'm\npretty sure now that my friend Trevor Blackwell is a great hacker.\nYou may have read on Slashdot how he made his \nown Segway.  The\nremarkable thing about this project was that he wrote all the\nsoftware in one day (in Python, incidentally).For Trevor, that's\npar for the course.  But when I first met him, I thought he was a\ncomplete idiot.  He was standing in Robert Morris's office babbling\nat him about something or other, and I remember standing behind\nhim making frantic gestures at Robert to shoo this nut out of his\noffice so we could go to lunch.  Robert says he misjudged Trevor\nat first too.  Apparently when Robert first met him, Trevor had\njust begun a new scheme that involved writing down everything about\nevery aspect of his life on a stack of index cards, which he carried\nwith him everywhere.  He'd also just arrived from Canada, and had\na strong Canadian accent and a mullet.The problem is compounded by the fact that hackers, despite their\nreputation for social obliviousness, sometimes put a good deal of\neffort into seeming smart.  When I was in grad school I used to\nhang around the MIT AI Lab occasionally. It was kind of intimidating\nat first.  Everyone there spoke so fast.  But after a while I\nlearned the trick of speaking fast.  You don't have to think any\nfaster; just use twice as many words to say everything.  With this amount of noise in the signal, it's hard to tell good\nhackers when you meet them.  I can't tell, even now.  You also\ncan't tell from their resumes.  It seems like the only way to judge\na hacker is to work with him on something.And this is the reason that high-tech areas \nonly happen around universities.  The active ingredient\nhere is not so much the professors as the students.  Startups grow up\naround universities because universities bring together promising young\npeople and make them work on the same projects.  The\nsmart ones learn who the other smart ones are, and together\nthey cook up new projects of their own.Because you can't tell a great hacker except by working with him,\nhackers themselves can't tell how good they are.  This is true to\na degree in most fields.  I've found that people who\nare great at something are not so much convinced of their own\ngreatness as mystified at why everyone else seems so incompetent.\nBut it's particularly hard for hackers to know how good they are,\nbecause it's hard to compare their work.  This is easier in most\nother fields.  In the hundred meters, you know in 10 seconds who's\nfastest.  Even in math there seems to be a general consensus about\nwhich problems are hard to solve, and what constitutes a good\nsolution.  But hacking is like writing.  Who can say which of two\nnovels is better?  Certainly not the authors.With hackers, at least, other hackers can tell.  That's because,\nunlike novelists, hackers collaborate on projects.  When you get\nto hit a few difficult problems over the net at someone, you learn\npretty quickly how hard they hit them back.  But hackers can't\nwatch themselves at work.  So if you ask a great hacker how good\nhe is, he's almost certain to reply, I don't know.  He's not just\nbeing modest.  He really doesn't know.And none of us know, except about people we've actually worked\nwith.  Which puts us in a weird situation: we don't know who our\nheroes should be.  The hackers who become famous tend to become\nfamous by random accidents of PR.  Occasionally I need to give an\nexample of a great hacker, and I never know who to use.  The first\nnames that come to mind always tend to be people I know personally,\nbut it seems lame to use them.  So, I think, maybe I should say\nRichard Stallman, or Linus Torvalds, or Alan Kay, or someone famous\nlike that.  But I have no idea if these guys are great hackers.\nI've never worked with them on anything.If there is a Michael Jordan of hacking, no one knows, including\nhim.CultivationFinally, the question the hackers have all been wondering about:\nhow do you become a great hacker?  I don't know if it's possible\nto make yourself into one.  But it's certainly possible to do things\nthat make you stupid, and if you can make yourself stupid, you\ncan probably make yourself smart too.The key to being a good hacker may be to work on what you like.\nWhen I think about the great hackers I know, one thing they have\nin common is the extreme \ndifficulty of making them work \non anything they\ndon't want to.  I don't know if this is cause or effect; it may be\nboth.To do something well you have to love it.  \nSo to the extent you\ncan preserve hacking as something you love, you're likely to do it\nwell.  Try to keep the sense of wonder you had about programming at\nage 14.  If you're worried that your current job is rotting your\nbrain, it probably is.The best hackers tend to be smart, of course, but that's true in\na lot of fields.  Is there some quality that's unique to hackers?\nI asked some friends, and the number one thing they mentioned was\ncuriosity.  \nI'd always supposed that all smart people were curious--\nthat curiosity was simply the first derivative of knowledge.  But\napparently hackers are particularly curious, especially about how\nthings work.  That makes sense, because programs are in effect\ngiant descriptions of how things work.Several friends mentioned hackers' ability to concentrate-- their\nability, as one put it, to \"tune out everything outside their own\nheads.''  I've certainly noticed this.  And I've heard several \nhackers say that after drinking even half a beer they can't program at\nall.   So maybe hacking does require some special ability to focus.\nPerhaps great hackers can load a large amount of context into their\nhead, so that when they look at a line of code, they see not just\nthat line but the whole program around it.  John McPhee\nwrote that Bill Bradley's success as a basketball player was due\npartly to his extraordinary peripheral vision.  \"Perfect'' eyesight\nmeans about 47 degrees of vertical peripheral vision.  Bill Bradley\nhad 70; he could see the basket when he was looking at the floor.\nMaybe great hackers have some similar inborn ability.  (I cheat by\nusing a very dense language, \nwhich shrinks the court.)This could explain the disconnect over cubicles.  Maybe the people\nin charge of facilities, not having any concentration to shatter,\nhave no idea that working in a cubicle feels to a hacker like having\none's brain in a blender.  (Whereas Bill, if the rumors of autism\nare true, knows all too well.)One difference I've noticed between great hackers and smart people\nin general is that hackers are more \npolitically incorrect.  To the\nextent there is a secret handshake among good hackers, it's when they\nknow one another well enough to express opinions that would get\nthem stoned to death by the general public.  And I can see why\npolitical incorrectness would be a useful quality in programming.\nPrograms are very complex and, at least in the hands of good\nprogrammers, very fluid.  In such situations it's helpful to have\na habit of questioning assumptions.Can you cultivate these qualities?  I don't know.  But you can at\nleast not repress them.  So here is my best shot at a recipe.  If\nit is possible to make yourself into a great hacker, the way to do\nit may be to make the following deal with yourself: you never have\nto work on boring projects (unless your family will starve otherwise),\nand in return, you'll never allow yourself to do a half-assed job.\nAll the great hackers I know seem to have made that deal, though\nperhaps none of them had any choice in the matter.Notes\n[1] In fairness, I have to say that IBM makes decent hardware.  I\nwrote this on an IBM laptop.[2] They did turn out to be doomed.  They shut down a few months\nlater.[3] I think this is what people mean when they talk\nabout the \"meaning of life.\"  On the face of it, this seems an \nodd idea.  Life isn't an expression; how could it have meaning?\nBut it can have a quality that feels a lot like meaning.  In a project\nlike a compiler, you have to solve a lot of problems, but the problems\nall fall into a pattern, as in a signal.  Whereas when the problems\nyou have to solve are random, they seem like noise.\n[4] Einstein at one point worked designing refrigerators. (He had equity.)[5] It's hard to say exactly what constitutes research in the\ncomputer world, but as a first approximation, it's software that\ndoesn't have users.I don't think it's publication that makes the best hackers want to work\nin research departments.  I think it's mainly not having to have a\nthree hour meeting with a product manager about problems integrating\nthe Korean version of Word 13.27 with the talking paperclip.[6] Something similar has been happening for a long time in the\nconstruction industry. When you had a house built a couple hundred\nyears ago, the local builders built everything in it.  But increasingly\nwhat builders do is assemble components designed and manufactured\nby someone else.  This has, like the arrival of desktop publishing,\ngiven people the freedom to experiment in disastrous ways, but it\nis certainly more efficient.[7] Google is much more dangerous to Microsoft than Netscape was.\nProbably more dangerous than any other company has ever been.  Not\nleast because they're determined to fight.  On their job listing\npage, they say that one of their \"core values'' is \"Don't be evil.''\nFrom a company selling soybean oil or mining equipment, such a\nstatement would merely be eccentric.  But I think all of us in the\ncomputer world recognize who that is a declaration of war on.Thanks to Jessica Livingston, Robert Morris, and Sarah Harlin\nfor reading earlier versions of this talk.\n\nWant to start a startup?  Get funded by\nY Combinator.\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 2006To do something well you have to like it.   That idea is not exactly\nnovel.  We've got it down to four words: \"Do what you love.\"  But\nit's not enough just to tell people that.  Doing what you love is\ncomplicated.The very idea is foreign to what most of us learn as kids.  When I\nwas a kid, it seemed as if work and fun were opposites by definition.\nLife had two states: some of the time adults were making you do\nthings, and that was called work; the rest of the time you could\ndo what you wanted, and that was called playing.  Occasionally the\nthings adults made you do were fun, just as, occasionally, playing\nwasn't\u2014for example, if you fell and hurt yourself.  But except\nfor these few anomalous cases, work was pretty much defined as\nnot-fun.And it did not seem to be an accident. School, it was implied, was\ntedious because it was preparation for grownup work.The world then was divided into two groups, grownups and kids.\nGrownups, like some kind of cursed race, had to work.  Kids didn't,\nbut they did have to go to school, which was a dilute version of\nwork meant to prepare us for the real thing.  Much as we disliked\nschool, the grownups all agreed that grownup work was worse, and\nthat we had it easy.Teachers in particular all seemed to believe implicitly that work\nwas not fun.  Which is not surprising: work wasn't fun for most of\nthem.  Why did we have to memorize state capitals instead of playing\ndodgeball?  For the same reason they had to watch over a bunch of\nkids instead of lying on a beach.  You couldn't just do what you\nwanted.I'm not saying we should let little kids do whatever they want.\nThey may have to be made to work on certain things.  But if we make\nkids work on dull stuff, it might be wise to tell them that tediousness\nis not the defining quality of work, and indeed that the reason\nthey have to work on dull stuff now is so they can work on more\ninteresting stuff later.\n[1]Once, when I was about 9 or 10, my father told me I could be whatever\nI wanted when I grew up, so long as I enjoyed it.  I remember that\nprecisely because it seemed so anomalous.  It was like being told\nto use dry water.  Whatever I thought he meant, I didn't think he\nmeant work could literally be fun\u2014fun like playing.  It\ntook me years to grasp that.JobsBy high school, the prospect of an actual job was on the horizon.\nAdults would sometimes come to speak to us about their work, or we\nwould go to see them at work.  It was always understood that they\nenjoyed what they did.  In retrospect I think one may have: the\nprivate jet pilot.  But I don't think the bank manager really did.The main reason they all acted as if they enjoyed their work was\npresumably the upper-middle class convention that you're supposed\nto.  It would not merely be bad for your career to say that you\ndespised your job, but a social faux-pas.Why is it conventional to pretend to like what you do?  The first\nsentence of this essay explains that.  If you have to like something\nto do it well, then the most successful people will all like what\nthey do.  That's where the upper-middle class tradition comes from.\nJust as houses all over America are full of \nchairs\nthat are, without\nthe owners even knowing it, nth-degree imitations of chairs designed\n250 years ago for French kings, conventional attitudes about work\nare, without the owners even knowing it, nth-degree imitations of\nthe attitudes of people who've done great things.What a recipe for alienation.  By the time they reach an age to\nthink about what they'd like to do, most kids have been thoroughly\nmisled about the idea of loving one's work.  School has trained\nthem to regard work as an unpleasant duty.  Having a job is said\nto be even more onerous than schoolwork.  And yet all the adults\nclaim to like what they do.  You can't blame kids for thinking \"I\nam not like these people; I am not suited to this world.\"Actually they've been told three lies: the stuff they've been taught\nto regard as work in school is not real work; grownup work is not\n(necessarily) worse than schoolwork; and many of the adults around\nthem are lying when they say they like what they do.The most dangerous liars can be the kids' own parents.  If you take\na boring job to give your family a high standard of living, as so\nmany people do, you risk infecting your kids with the idea that\nwork is boring. \n[2]\nMaybe it would be better for kids in this one\ncase if parents were not so unselfish.  A parent who set an example\nof loving their work might help their kids more than an expensive\nhouse.\n[3]It was not till I was in college that the idea of work finally broke\nfree from the idea of making a living.  Then the important question\nbecame not how to make money, but what to work on.  Ideally these\ncoincided, but some spectacular boundary cases (like Einstein in\nthe patent office) proved they weren't identical.The definition of work was now to make some original contribution\nto the world, and in the process not to starve.  But after the habit\nof so many years my idea of work still included a large component\nof pain.  Work still seemed to require discipline, because only\nhard problems yielded grand results, and hard problems couldn't\nliterally be fun.   Surely one had to force oneself to work on them.If you think something's supposed to hurt, you're less likely to\nnotice if you're doing it wrong.  That about sums up my experience\nof graduate school.BoundsHow much are you supposed to like what you do?  Unless you\nknow that, you don't know when to stop searching. And if, like most\npeople, you underestimate it, you'll tend to stop searching too\nearly.  You'll end up doing something chosen for you by your parents,\nor the desire to make money, or prestige\u2014or sheer inertia.Here's an upper bound: Do what you love doesn't mean, do what you\nwould like to do most this second.  Even Einstein probably\nhad moments when he wanted to have a cup of coffee, but told himself\nhe ought to finish what he was working on first.It used to perplex me when I read about people who liked what they\ndid so much that there was nothing they'd rather do.  There didn't\nseem to be any sort of work I liked that much.  If I had a\nchoice of (a) spending the next hour working on something or (b)\nbe teleported to Rome and spend the next hour wandering about, was\nthere any sort of work I'd prefer?  Honestly, no.But the fact is, almost anyone would rather, at any given moment,\nfloat about in the Carribbean, or have sex, or eat some delicious\nfood, than work on hard problems.  The rule about doing what you\nlove assumes a certain length of time.  It doesn't mean, do what\nwill make you happiest this second, but what will make you happiest\nover some longer period, like a week or a month.Unproductive pleasures pall eventually.  After a while you get tired\nof lying on the beach.  If you want to stay happy, you have to do\nsomething.As a lower bound, you have to like your work more than any unproductive\npleasure.  You have to like what you do enough that the concept of\n\"spare time\" seems mistaken.  Which is not to say you have to spend\nall your time working.  You can only work so much before you get\ntired and start to screw up.  Then you want to do something else\u2014even something mindless.  But you don't regard this time as the\nprize and the time you spend working as the pain you endure to earn\nit.I put the lower bound there for practical reasons.  If your work\nis not your favorite thing to do, you'll have terrible problems\nwith procrastination.  You'll have to force yourself to work,  and\nwhen you resort to that the results are distinctly inferior.To be happy I think you have to be doing something you not only\nenjoy, but admire.  You have to be able to say, at the end, wow,\nthat's pretty cool.  This doesn't mean you have to make something.\nIf you learn how to hang glide, or to speak a foreign language\nfluently, that will be enough to make you say, for a while at least,\nwow, that's pretty cool.  What there has to be is a test.So one thing that falls just short of the standard, I think, is\nreading books.  Except for some books in math and the hard sciences,\nthere's no test of how well you've read a book, and that's why\nmerely reading books doesn't quite feel like work.  You have to do\nsomething with what you've read to feel productive.I think the best test is one Gino Lee taught me: to try to do things\nthat would make your friends say wow.  But it probably wouldn't\nstart to work properly till about age 22, because most people haven't\nhad a big enough sample to pick friends from before then.SirensWhat you should not do, I think, is worry about the opinion of\nanyone beyond your friends.  You shouldn't worry about prestige.\nPrestige is the opinion of the rest of the world.  When you can ask\nthe opinions of people whose judgement you respect, what does it\nadd to consider the opinions of people you don't even know? \n[4]This is easy advice to give.  It's hard to follow, especially when\nyou're young.  \n[5]\nPrestige is like a powerful magnet that warps\neven your beliefs about what you enjoy.  It causes you to work not\non what you like, but what you'd like to like.That's what leads people to try to write novels, for example.  They\nlike reading novels.  They notice that people who write them win\nNobel prizes.  What could be more wonderful, they think, than to\nbe a novelist?  But liking the idea of being a novelist is not\nenough; you have to like the actual work of novel-writing if you're\ngoing to be good at it; you have to like making up elaborate lies.Prestige is just fossilized inspiration.  If you do anything well\nenough, you'll make it prestigious.  Plenty of things we now\nconsider prestigious were anything but at first.  Jazz comes to\nmind\u2014though almost any established art form would do.   So just\ndo what you like, and let prestige take care of itself.Prestige is especially dangerous to the ambitious.  If you want to\nmake ambitious people waste their time on errands, the way to do\nit is to bait the hook with prestige.  That's the recipe for getting\npeople to give talks, write forewords, serve on committees, be\ndepartment heads, and so on.  It might be a good rule simply to\navoid any prestigious task. If it didn't suck, they wouldn't have\nhad to make it prestigious.Similarly, if you admire two kinds of work equally, but one is more\nprestigious, you should probably choose the other.  Your opinions\nabout what's admirable are always going to be slightly influenced\nby prestige, so if the two seem equal to you, you probably have\nmore genuine admiration for the less prestigious one.The other big force leading people astray is money.  Money by itself\nis not that dangerous.  When something pays well but is regarded\nwith contempt, like telemarketing, or prostitution, or personal\ninjury litigation, ambitious people aren't tempted by it.  That\nkind of work ends up being done by people who are \"just trying to\nmake a living.\"  (Tip: avoid any field whose practitioners say\nthis.)  The danger is when money is combined with prestige, as in,\nsay, corporate law, or medicine.  A comparatively safe and prosperous\ncareer with some automatic baseline prestige is dangerously tempting\nto someone young, who hasn't thought much about what they really\nlike.The test of whether people love what they do is whether they'd do\nit even if they weren't paid for it\u2014even if they had to work at\nanother job to make a living.  How many corporate lawyers would do\ntheir current work if they had to do it for free, in their spare\ntime, and take day jobs as waiters to support themselves?This test is especially helpful in deciding between different kinds\nof academic work, because fields vary greatly in this respect.  Most\ngood mathematicians would work on math even if there were no jobs\nas math professors, whereas in the departments at the other end of\nthe spectrum, the availability of teaching jobs is the driver:\npeople would rather be English professors than work in ad agencies,\nand publishing papers is the way you compete for such jobs.  Math\nwould happen without math departments, but it is the existence of\nEnglish majors, and therefore jobs teaching them, that calls into\nbeing all those thousands of dreary papers about gender and identity\nin the novels of Conrad.  No one does \nthat \nkind of thing for fun.The advice of parents will tend to err on the side of money.  It\nseems safe to say there are more undergrads who want to be novelists\nand whose parents want them to be doctors than who want to be doctors\nand whose parents want them to be novelists.  The kids think their\nparents are \"materialistic.\" Not necessarily.  All parents tend to\nbe more conservative for their kids than they would for themselves,\nsimply because, as parents, they share risks more than rewards.  If\nyour eight year old son decides to climb a tall tree, or your teenage\ndaughter decides to date the local bad boy, you won't get a share\nin the excitement, but if your son falls, or your daughter gets\npregnant, you'll have to deal with the consequences.DisciplineWith such powerful forces leading us astray, it's not surprising\nwe find it so hard to discover what we like to work on.  Most people\nare doomed in childhood by accepting the axiom that work = pain.\nThose who escape this are nearly all lured onto the rocks by prestige\nor money.  How many even discover something they love to work on?\nA few hundred thousand, perhaps, out of billions.It's hard to find work you love; it must be, if so few do.  So don't\nunderestimate this task.  And don't feel bad if you haven't succeeded\nyet.  In fact, if you admit to yourself that you're discontented,\nyou're a step ahead of most people, who are still in denial.  If\nyou're surrounded by colleagues who claim to enjoy work that you\nfind contemptible, odds are they're lying to themselves.  Not\nnecessarily, but probably.Although doing great work takes less discipline than people think\u2014because the way to do great work is to find something you like so\nmuch that you don't have to force yourself to do it\u2014finding\nwork you love does usually require discipline.   Some people are\nlucky enough to know what they want to do when they're 12, and just\nglide along as if they were on railroad tracks.  But this seems the\nexception.  More often people who do great things have careers with\nthe trajectory of a ping-pong ball.  They go to school to study A,\ndrop out and get a job doing B, and then become famous for C after\ntaking it up on the side.Sometimes jumping from one sort of work to another is a sign of\nenergy, and sometimes it's a sign of laziness.  Are you dropping\nout, or boldly carving a new path?  You often can't tell yourself.\nPlenty of people who will later do great things seem to be disappointments\nearly on, when they're trying to find their niche.Is there some test you can use to keep yourself honest?  One is to\ntry to do a good job at whatever you're doing, even if you don't\nlike it.  Then at least you'll know you're not using dissatisfaction\nas an excuse for being lazy.  Perhaps more importantly, you'll get\ninto the habit of doing things well.Another test you can use is: always produce.  For example, if you\nhave a day job you don't take seriously because you plan to be a\nnovelist, are you producing?  Are you writing pages of fiction,\nhowever bad?  As long as you're producing, you'll know you're not\nmerely using the hazy vision of the grand novel you plan to write\none day as an opiate.  The view of it will be obstructed by the all\ntoo palpably flawed one you're actually writing.\"Always produce\" is also a heuristic for finding the work you love.\nIf you subject yourself to that constraint, it will automatically\npush you away from things you think you're supposed to work on,\ntoward things you actually like.  \"Always produce\" will discover\nyour life's work the way water, with the aid of gravity, finds the\nhole in your roof.Of course, figuring out what you like to work on doesn't mean you\nget to work on it.  That's a separate question.  And if you're\nambitious you have to keep them separate: you have to make a conscious\neffort to keep your ideas about what you want from being contaminated\nby what seems possible. \n[6]It's painful to keep them apart, because it's painful to observe\nthe gap between them. So most people pre-emptively lower their\nexpectations.  For example, if you asked random people on the street\nif they'd like to be able to draw like Leonardo, you'd find most\nwould say something like \"Oh, I can't draw.\"  This is more a statement\nof intention than fact; it means, I'm not going to try.  Because\nthe fact is, if you took a random person off the street and somehow\ngot them to work as hard as they possibly could at drawing for the\nnext twenty years, they'd get surprisingly far.  But it would require\na great moral effort; it would mean staring failure in the eye every\nday for years.  And so to protect themselves people say \"I can't.\"Another related line you often hear is that not everyone can do\nwork they love\u2014that someone has to do the unpleasant jobs.  Really?\nHow do you make them?  In the US the only mechanism for forcing\npeople to do unpleasant jobs is the draft, and that hasn't been\ninvoked for over 30 years.  All we can do is encourage people to\ndo unpleasant work, with money and prestige.If there's something people still won't do, it seems as if society\njust has to make do without.  That's what happened with domestic\nservants.  For millennia that was the canonical example of a job\n\"someone had to do.\"  And yet in the mid twentieth century servants\npractically disappeared in rich countries, and the rich have just\nhad to do without.So while there may be some things someone has to do, there's a good\nchance anyone saying that about any particular job is mistaken.\nMost unpleasant jobs would either get automated or go undone if no\none were willing to do them.Two RoutesThere's another sense of \"not everyone can do work they love\"\nthat's all too true, however.  One has to make a living, and it's\nhard to get paid for doing work you love.  There are two routes to\nthat destination:\n\n  The organic route: as you become more eminent, gradually to\n  increase the parts of your job that you like at the expense of\n  those you don't.The two-job route: to work at things you don't like to get money\n  to work on things you do.\n\nThe organic route is more common.  It happens naturally to anyone\nwho does good work.  A young architect has to take whatever work\nhe can get, but if he does well he'll gradually be in a position\nto pick and choose among projects.  The disadvantage of this route\nis that it's slow and uncertain.  Even tenure is not real freedom.The two-job route has several variants depending on how long you\nwork for money at a time.  At one extreme is the \"day job,\" where\nyou work regular hours at one job to make money, and work on what\nyou love in your spare time.  At the other extreme you work at\nsomething till you make enough not to \nhave to work for money again.The two-job route is less common than the organic route, because\nit requires a deliberate choice.  It's also more dangerous.  Life\ntends to get more expensive as you get older, so it's easy to get\nsucked into working longer than you expected at the money job.\nWorse still, anything you work on changes you.  If you work too\nlong on tedious stuff, it will rot your brain.  And the best paying\njobs are most dangerous, because they require your full attention.The advantage of the two-job route is that it lets you jump over\nobstacles.  The landscape of possible jobs isn't flat; there are\nwalls of varying heights between different kinds of work. \n[7]\nThe trick of maximizing the parts of your job that you like can get you\nfrom architecture to product design, but not, probably, to music.\nIf you make money doing one thing and then work on another, you\nhave more freedom of choice.Which route should you take?  That depends on how sure you are of\nwhat you want to do, how good you are at taking orders, how much\nrisk you can stand, and the odds that anyone will pay (in your\nlifetime) for what you want to do.  If you're sure of the general\narea you want to work in and it's something people are likely to\npay you for, then you should probably take the organic route.  But\nif you don't know what you want to work on, or don't like to take\norders, you may want to take the two-job route, if you can stand\nthe risk.Don't decide too soon.  Kids who know early what they want to do\nseem impressive, as if they got the answer to some math question\nbefore the other kids.  They have an answer, certainly, but odds\nare it's wrong.A friend of mine who is a quite successful doctor complains constantly\nabout her job.  When people applying to medical school ask her for\nadvice, she wants to shake them and yell \"Don't do it!\"  (But she\nnever does.) How did she get into this fix?  In high school she\nalready wanted to be a doctor.  And she is so ambitious and determined\nthat she overcame every obstacle along the way\u2014including,\nunfortunately, not liking it.Now she has a life chosen for her by a high-school kid.When you're young, you're given the impression that you'll get\nenough information to make each choice before you need to make it.\nBut this is certainly not so with work.  When you're deciding what\nto do, you have to operate on ridiculously incomplete information.\nEven in college you get little idea what various types of work are\nlike.  At best you may have a couple internships, but not all jobs\noffer internships, and those that do don't teach you much more about\nthe work than being a batboy teaches you about playing baseball.In the design of lives, as in the design of most other things, you\nget better results if you use flexible media.  So unless you're\nfairly sure what you want to do, your best bet may be to choose a\ntype of work that could turn into either an organic or two-job\ncareer.  That was probably part of the reason I chose computers.\nYou can be a professor, or make a lot of money, or morph it into\nany number of other kinds of work.It's also wise, early on, to seek jobs that let you do many different\nthings, so you can learn faster what various kinds of work are like.\nConversely, the extreme version of the two-job route is dangerous\nbecause it teaches you so little about what you like.  If you work\nhard at being a bond trader for ten years, thinking that you'll\nquit and write novels when you have enough money, what happens when\nyou quit and then discover that you don't actually like writing\nnovels?Most people would say, I'd take that problem.  Give me a million\ndollars and I'll figure out what to do.  But it's harder than it\nlooks.  Constraints give your life shape.  Remove them and most\npeople have no idea what to do: look at what happens to those who\nwin lotteries or inherit money.  Much as everyone thinks they want\nfinancial security, the happiest people are not those who have it,\nbut those who like what they do.  So a plan that promises freedom\nat the expense of knowing what to do with it may not be as good as\nit seems.Whichever route you take, expect a struggle.  Finding work you love\nis very difficult.  Most people fail.  Even if you succeed, it's\nrare to be free to work on what you want till your thirties or\nforties.  But if you have the destination in sight you'll be more\nlikely to arrive at it.  If you know you can love work, you're in\nthe home stretch, and if you know what work you love, you're\npractically there.Notes[1]\nCurrently we do the opposite: when we make kids do boring work,\nlike arithmetic drills, instead of admitting frankly that it's\nboring, we try to disguise it with superficial decorations.[2]\nOne father told me about a related phenomenon: he found himself\nconcealing from his family how much he liked his work.  When he\nwanted to go to work on a saturday, he found it easier to say that\nit was because he \"had to\" for some reason, rather than admitting\nhe preferred to work than stay home with them.[3]\nSomething similar happens with suburbs.  Parents move to suburbs\nto raise their kids in a safe environment, but suburbs are so dull\nand artificial that by the time they're fifteen the kids are convinced\nthe whole world is boring.[4]\nI'm not saying friends should be the only audience for your\nwork.  The more people you can help, the better.  But friends should\nbe your compass.[5]\nDonald Hall said young would-be poets were mistaken to be so\nobsessed with being published.  But you can imagine what it would\ndo for a 24 year old to get a poem published in The New Yorker.\nNow to people he meets at parties he's a real poet.  Actually he's\nno better or worse than he was before, but to a clueless audience\nlike that, the approval of an official authority makes all the\ndifference.   So it's a harder problem than Hall realizes.  The\nreason the young care so much about prestige is that the people\nthey want to impress are not very discerning.[6]\nThis is isomorphic to the principle that you should prevent\nyour beliefs about how things are from being contaminated by how\nyou wish they were.  Most people let them mix pretty promiscuously.\nThe continuing popularity of religion is the most visible index of\nthat.[7]\nA more accurate metaphor would be to say that the graph of jobs\nis not very well connected.Thanks to Trevor Blackwell, Dan Friedman, Sarah Harlin,\nJessica Livingston, Jackie McDonough, Robert Morris, Peter Norvig, \nDavid Sloo, and Aaron Swartz\nfor reading drafts of this.May 2006(This essay is derived from a keynote at Xtech.)Could you reproduce Silicon Valley elsewhere, or is there something\nunique about it?It wouldn't be surprising if it were hard to reproduce in other\ncountries, because you couldn't reproduce it in most of the US\neither.  What does it take to make a silicon valley even here?What it takes is the right people.  If you could get the right ten\nthousand people to move from Silicon Valley to Buffalo, Buffalo\nwould become Silicon Valley.  \n[1]That's a striking departure from the past.  Up till a couple decades\nago, geography was destiny for cities.  All great cities were located\non waterways, because cities made money by trade, and water was the\nonly economical way to ship.Now you could make a great city anywhere, if you could get the right\npeople to move there.  So the question of how to make a silicon\nvalley becomes: who are the right people, and how do you get them\nto move?Two TypesI think you only need two kinds of people to create a technology\nhub: rich people and nerds.  They're the limiting reagents in the\nreaction that produces startups, because they're the only ones\npresent when startups get started.  Everyone else will move.Observation bears this out: within the US, towns have become startup\nhubs if and only if they have both rich people and nerds.  Few\nstartups happen in Miami, for example, because although it's full\nof rich people, it has few nerds.  It's not the kind of place nerds\nlike.Whereas Pittsburgh has the opposite problem: plenty of nerds, but\nno rich people.  The top US Computer Science departments are said\nto be MIT, Stanford, Berkeley, and Carnegie-Mellon.  MIT yielded\nRoute 128.  Stanford and Berkeley yielded Silicon Valley.  But\nCarnegie-Mellon?  The record skips at that point.  Lower down the\nlist, the University of Washington yielded a high-tech community\nin Seattle, and the University of Texas at Austin yielded one in\nAustin.  But what happened in Pittsburgh?  And in Ithaca, home of\nCornell, which is also high on the list?I grew up in Pittsburgh and went to college at Cornell, so I can\nanswer for both.  The weather is terrible,  particularly in winter,\nand there's no interesting old city to make up for it, as there is\nin Boston.  Rich people don't want to live in Pittsburgh or Ithaca.\nSo while there are plenty of hackers who could start startups,\nthere's no one to invest in them.Not BureaucratsDo you really need the rich people?  Wouldn't it work to have the\ngovernment invest in the nerds?  No, it would not.  Startup investors\nare a distinct type of rich people.  They tend to have a lot of\nexperience themselves in the technology business.  This (a) helps\nthem pick the right startups, and (b) means they can supply advice\nand connections as well as money.  And the fact that they have a\npersonal stake in the outcome makes them really pay attention.Bureaucrats by their nature are the exact opposite sort of people\nfrom startup investors. The idea of them making startup investments\nis comic.  It would be like mathematicians running Vogue-- or\nperhaps more accurately, Vogue editors running a math journal.\n[2]Though indeed, most things bureaucrats do, they do badly.   We just\ndon't notice usually, because they only have to compete against\nother bureaucrats.  But as startup investors they'd have to compete\nagainst pros with a great deal more experience and motivation.Even corporations that have in-house VC groups generally forbid\nthem to make their own investment decisions.  Most are only allowed\nto invest in deals where some reputable private VC firm is willing\nto act as lead investor.Not BuildingsIf you go to see Silicon Valley, what you'll see are buildings.\nBut it's the people that make it Silicon Valley, not the buildings.\nI read occasionally about attempts to set up \"technology\nparks\" in other places, as if the active ingredient of Silicon\nValley were the office space.  An article about Sophia Antipolis\nbragged that companies there included Cisco, Compaq, IBM, NCR, and\nNortel.  Don't the French realize these aren't startups?Building office buildings for technology companies won't get you a\nsilicon valley, because the key stage in the life of a startup\nhappens before they want that kind of space.  The key stage is when\nthey're three guys operating out of an apartment.  Wherever the\nstartup is when it gets funded, it will stay.  The defining quality\nof Silicon Valley is not that Intel or Apple or Google have offices\nthere, but that they were started there.So if you want to reproduce Silicon Valley, what you need to reproduce\nis those two or three founders sitting around a kitchen table\ndeciding to start a company.  And to reproduce that you need those\npeople.UniversitiesThe exciting thing is, all you need are the people.  If you could\nattract a critical mass of nerds and investors to live somewhere,\nyou could reproduce Silicon Valley.  And both groups are highly\nmobile.  They'll go where life is good.  So what makes a place good\nto them?What nerds like is other nerds.  Smart people will go wherever other\nsmart people are.  And in particular, to great universities.  In\ntheory there could be other ways to attract them, but so far\nuniversities seem to be indispensable.  Within the US, there are\nno technology hubs without first-rate universities-- or at least,\nfirst-rate computer science departments.So if you want to make a silicon valley, you not only need a\nuniversity, but one of the top handful in the world.  It has to be\ngood enough to act as a magnet, drawing the best people from thousands\nof miles away.  And that means it has to stand up to existing magnets\nlike MIT and Stanford.This sounds hard.  Actually it might be easy.  My professor friends,\nwhen they're deciding where they'd like to work, consider one thing\nabove all: the quality of the other faculty.  What attracts professors\nis good colleagues.  So if you managed to recruit, en masse, a\nsignificant number of the best young researchers, you could create\na first-rate university from nothing overnight.  And you could do\nthat for surprisingly little.  If you paid 200 people hiring bonuses\nof $3 million apiece, you could put together a faculty that would\nbear comparison with any in the world.  And from that point the\nchain reaction would be self-sustaining.  So whatever it costs to\nestablish a mediocre university, for an additional half billion or\nso you could have a great one.  \n[3]PersonalityHowever, merely creating a new university would not be enough to\nstart a silicon valley. The university is just the seed.  It has\nto be planted in the right soil, or it won't germinate.  Plant it\nin the wrong place, and you just create Carnegie-Mellon.To spawn startups, your university has to be in a town that has\nattractions other than the university.  It has to be a place where\ninvestors want to live, and students want to stay after they graduate.The two like much the same things, because most startup investors\nare nerds themselves.  So what do nerds look for in a town?  Their\ntastes aren't completely different from other people's, because a\nlot of the towns they like most in the US are also big tourist\ndestinations: San Francisco, Boston, Seattle.   But their tastes\ncan't be quite mainstream either, because they dislike other big\ntourist destinations, like New York, Los Angeles, and Las Vegas.There has been a lot written lately about the \"creative class.\" The\nthesis seems to be that as wealth derives increasingly from ideas,\ncities will prosper only if they attract those who have them.  That\nis certainly true; in fact it was the basis of Amsterdam's prosperity\n400 years ago.A lot of nerd tastes they share with the creative class in general.\nFor example, they like well-preserved old neighborhoods instead of\ncookie-cutter suburbs, and locally-owned shops and restaurants\ninstead of national chains.  Like the rest of the creative class,\nthey want to live somewhere with personality.What exactly is personality?  I think it's the feeling that each\nbuilding is the work of a distinct group of people.  A town with\npersonality is one that doesn't feel mass-produced.  So if you want\nto make a startup hub-- or any town to attract the \"creative class\"--\nyou probably have to ban large development projects.\nWhen a large tract has been developed by a single organization, you\ncan always tell. \n[4]Most towns with personality are old, but they don't have to be.\nOld towns have two advantages: they're denser, because they were\nlaid out before cars, and they're more varied, because they were\nbuilt one building at a time.  You could have both now.  Just have\nbuilding codes that ensure density, and ban large scale developments.A corollary is that you have to keep out the biggest developer of\nall: the government.  A government that asks \"How can we build a\nsilicon valley?\" has probably ensured failure by the way they framed\nthe question.  You don't build a silicon valley; you let one grow.NerdsIf you want to attract nerds, you need more than a town with\npersonality.  You need a town with the right personality.  Nerds\nare a distinct subset of the creative class, with different tastes\nfrom the rest.  You can see this most clearly in New York, which\nattracts a lot of creative people, but few nerds. \n[5]What nerds like is the kind of town where people walk around smiling.\nThis excludes LA, where no one walks at all, and also New York,\nwhere people walk, but not smiling. When I was in grad school in\nBoston, a friend came to visit from New York.  On the subway back\nfrom the airport she asked \"Why is everyone smiling?\"  I looked and\nthey weren't smiling.  They just looked like they were compared to\nthe facial expressions she was used to.If you've lived in New York, you know where these facial expressions\ncome from.  It's the kind of place where your mind may be excited,\nbut your body knows it's having a bad time.  People don't so much\nenjoy living there as endure it for the sake of the excitement.\nAnd if you like certain kinds of excitement, New York is incomparable.\nIt's a hub of glamour, a magnet for all the shorter half-life\nisotopes of style and fame.Nerds don't care about glamour, so to them the appeal of New York\nis a mystery.  People who like New York will pay a fortune for a\nsmall, dark, noisy apartment in order to live in a town where the\ncool people are really cool.  A nerd looks at that deal and sees\nonly: pay a fortune for a small, dark, noisy apartment.Nerds will pay a premium to live in a town where the smart people\nare really smart, but you don't have to pay as much for that.  It's\nsupply and demand: glamour is popular, so you have to pay a lot for\nit.Most nerds like quieter pleasures.  They like cafes instead of\nclubs; used bookshops instead of fashionable clothing shops; hiking\ninstead of dancing; sunlight instead of tall buildings.  A nerd's\nidea of paradise is Berkeley or Boulder.YouthIt's the young nerds who start startups, so it's those specifically\nthe city has to appeal to.  The startup hubs in the US are all\nyoung-feeling towns.  This doesn't mean they have to be new.\nCambridge has the oldest town plan in America, but it feels young\nbecause it's full of students.What you can't have, if you want to create a silicon valley, is a\nlarge, existing population of stodgy people.  It would be a waste\nof time to try to reverse the fortunes of a declining industrial town\nlike Detroit or Philadelphia by trying to encourage startups.  Those\nplaces have too much momentum in the wrong direction.  You're better\noff starting with a blank slate in the form of a small town.  Or\nbetter still, if there's a town young people already flock to, that\none.The Bay Area was a magnet for the young and optimistic for decades\nbefore it was associated with technology.  It was a place people\nwent in search of something new.  And so it became synonymous with\nCalifornia nuttiness.  There's still a lot of that there.  If you\nwanted to start a new fad-- a new way to focus one's \"energy,\" for\nexample, or a new category of things not to eat-- the Bay Area would\nbe the place to do it.  But a place that tolerates oddness in the\nsearch for the new is exactly what you want in a startup hub, because\neconomically that's what startups are.  Most good startup ideas\nseem a little crazy; if they were obviously good ideas, someone\nwould have done them already.(How many people are going to want computers in their houses?\nWhat, another search engine?)That's the connection between technology and liberalism.  Without\nexception the high-tech cities in the US are also the most liberal.\nBut it's not because liberals are smarter that this is so.  It's\nbecause liberal cities tolerate odd ideas, and smart people by\ndefinition have odd ideas.Conversely, a town that gets praised for being \"solid\" or representing\n\"traditional values\" may be a fine place to live, but it's never\ngoing to succeed as a startup hub.  The 2004 presidential election,\nthough a disaster in other respects, conveniently supplied us with\na county-by-county \nmap of such places.  \n[6]To attract the young, a town must have an intact center.  In most\nAmerican cities the center has been abandoned, and the growth, if\nany, is in the suburbs.  Most American cities have been turned\ninside out. But none of the startup hubs has: not San Francisco,\nor Boston, or Seattle.  They all have intact centers.\n[7]\nMy guess is that no city with a dead center could be turned into a\nstartup hub.  Young people don't want to live in the suburbs.Within the US, the two cities I think could most easily be turned\ninto new silicon valleys are Boulder and Portland.  Both have the\nkind of effervescent feel that attracts the young.  They're each\nonly a great university short of becoming a silicon valley, if they\nwanted to.TimeA great university near an attractive town.  Is that all it takes?\nThat was all it took to make the original Silicon Valley.  Silicon\nValley traces its origins to William Shockley, one of the inventors\nof the transistor.  He did the research that won him the Nobel Prize\nat Bell Labs, but when he started his own company in 1956 he moved\nto Palo Alto to do it.   At the time that was an odd thing to do.\nWhy did he?  Because he had grown up there and remembered how nice\nit was.  Now Palo Alto is suburbia, but then it was a charming\ncollege town-- a charming college town with perfect weather and San\nFrancisco only an hour away.The companies that rule Silicon Valley now are all descended in\nvarious ways from Shockley Semiconductor.  Shockley was a difficult\nman, and in 1957 his top people-- \"the traitorous eight\"-- left to\nstart a new company, Fairchild Semiconductor.  Among them were\nGordon Moore and Robert Noyce, who went on to found Intel, and\nEugene Kleiner, who founded the VC firm Kleiner Perkins.  Forty-two\nyears later, Kleiner Perkins funded Google, and the partner responsible\nfor the deal was John Doerr, who came to Silicon Valley in 1974 to\nwork for Intel.So although a lot of the newest companies in Silicon Valley don't\nmake anything out of silicon, there always seem to be multiple links\nback to Shockley.  There's a lesson here: startups beget startups.\nPeople who work for startups start their own.  People who get rich\nfrom startups fund new ones.  I suspect this kind of organic growth\nis the only way to produce a startup hub, because it's the only way\nto grow the expertise you need.That has two important implications.  The first is that you need\ntime to grow a silicon valley.  The university you could create in\na couple years, but the startup community around it has to grow\norganically.   The cycle time is limited by the time it takes a\ncompany to succeed, which probably averages about five years.The other implication of the organic growth hypothesis is that you\ncan't be somewhat of a startup hub.  You either have a self-sustaining\nchain reaction, or not.  Observation confirms this too: cities\neither have a startup scene, or they don't.  There is no middle\nground.  Chicago has the third largest metropolitan area in America.\nAs source of startups it's negligible compared to Seattle, number 15.The good news is that the initial seed can be quite small.  Shockley\nSemiconductor, though itself not very successful, was big enough.\nIt brought a critical mass of experts in an important new technology\ntogether in a place they liked enough to stay.CompetingOf course, a would-be silicon valley faces an obstacle the original\none didn't: it has to compete with Silicon Valley.  Can that be\ndone?  Probably.One of Silicon Valley's biggest advantages is its venture capital\nfirms.  This was not a factor in Shockley's day, because VC funds\ndidn't exist.  In fact, Shockley Semiconductor and Fairchild\nSemiconductor were not startups at all in our sense.  They were\nsubsidiaries-- of Beckman Instruments and Fairchild Camera and\nInstrument respectively.  Those companies were apparently willing\nto establish subsidiaries wherever the experts wanted to live.Venture investors, however, prefer to fund startups within an hour's\ndrive.  For one, they're more likely to notice startups nearby.\nBut when they do notice startups in other towns they prefer them\nto move.  They don't want to have to travel to attend board meetings,\nand in any case the odds of succeeding are higher in a startup hub.The centralizing effect of venture firms is a double one: they cause\nstartups to form around them, and those draw in more startups through\nacquisitions.  And although the first may be weakening because it's\nnow so cheap to start some startups, the second seems as strong as ever.\nThree of the most admired\n\"Web 2.0\" companies were started outside the usual startup hubs,\nbut two of them have already been reeled in through acquisitions.Such centralizing forces make it harder for new silicon valleys to\nget started.  But by no means impossible.  Ultimately power rests\nwith the founders.  A startup with the best people will beat one\nwith funding from famous VCs, and a startup that was sufficiently\nsuccessful would never have to move.  So a town that\ncould exert enough pull over the right people could resist and\nperhaps even surpass Silicon Valley.For all its power, Silicon Valley has a great weakness: the paradise\nShockley found in 1956 is now one giant parking lot.  San Francisco\nand Berkeley are great, but they're forty miles away.  Silicon\nValley proper is soul-crushing suburban sprawl.  It\nhas fabulous weather, which makes it significantly better than the\nsoul-crushing sprawl of most other American cities.  But a competitor\nthat managed to avoid sprawl would have real leverage.  All a city\nneeds is to be the kind of place the next traitorous eight look at\nand say \"I want to stay here,\" and that would be enough to get the\nchain reaction started.Notes[1]\nIt's interesting to consider how low this number could be\nmade.  I suspect five hundred would be enough, even if they could\nbring no assets with them.  Probably just thirty, if I could pick them, \nwould be enough to turn Buffalo into a significant startup hub.[2]\nBureaucrats manage to allocate research funding moderately\nwell, but only because (like an in-house VC fund) they outsource\nmost of the work of selection.  A professor at a famous university\nwho is highly regarded by his peers will get funding, pretty much\nregardless of the proposal.  That wouldn't work for startups, whose\nfounders aren't sponsored by organizations, and are often unknowns.[3]\nYou'd have to do it all at once, or at least a whole department\nat a time, because people would be more likely to come if they\nknew their friends were.  And you should probably start from scratch,\nrather than trying to upgrade an existing university, or much energy\nwould be lost in friction.[4]\nHypothesis: Any plan in which multiple independent buildings\nare gutted or demolished to be \"redeveloped\" as a single project\nis a net loss of personality for the city, with the exception of\nthe conversion of buildings not previously public, like warehouses.[5]\nA few startups get started in New York, but less\nthan a tenth as many per capita as in Boston, and mostly\nin less nerdy fields like finance and media.[6]\nSome blue counties are false positives (reflecting the\nremaining power of Democractic party machines), but there are no\nfalse negatives.  You can safely write off all the red counties.[7]\nSome \"urban renewal\" experts took a shot at destroying Boston's\nin the 1960s, leaving the area around city hall a bleak wasteland,\nbut most neighborhoods successfully resisted them.Thanks to Chris Anderson, Trevor Blackwell, Marc Hedlund,\nJessica Livingston, Robert Morris, Greg Mcadoo, Fred Wilson,\nand Stephen Wolfram for\nreading drafts of this, and to Ed Dumbill for inviting me to speak.(The second part of this talk became Why Startups\nCondense in America.)January 2015Corporate Development, aka corp dev, is the group within companies\nthat buys other companies. If you're talking to someone from corp\ndev, that's why, whether you realize it yet or not.It's usually a mistake to talk to corp dev unless (a) you want to\nsell your company right now and (b) you're sufficiently likely to\nget an offer at an acceptable price.  In practice that means startups\nshould only talk to corp dev when they're either doing really well\nor really badly.  If you're doing really badly, meaning the company\nis about to die, you may as well talk to them, because you have\nnothing to lose. And if you're doing really well, you can safely\ntalk to them, because you both know the price will have to be high,\nand if they show the slightest sign of wasting your time, you'll\nbe confident enough to tell them to get lost.The danger is to companies in the middle.  Particularly to young\ncompanies that are growing fast, but haven't been doing it for long\nenough to have grown big yet.  It's usually a mistake for a promising\ncompany less than a year old even to talk to corp dev.But it's a mistake founders constantly make.  When someone from\ncorp dev wants to meet, the founders tell themselves they should\nat least find out what they want.  Besides, they don't want to\noffend Big Company by refusing to meet.Well, I'll tell you what they want.  They want to talk about buying\nyou.  That's what the title \"corp dev\" means.   So before agreeing\nto meet with someone from corp dev, ask yourselves, \"Do we want to\nsell the company right now?\"  And if the answer is no, tell them\n\"Sorry, but we're focusing on growing the company.\"  They won't be\noffended.  And certainly the founders of Big Company won't be\noffended. If anything they'll think more highly of you.  You'll\nremind them of themselves.  They didn't sell either; that's why\nthey're in a position now to buy other companies.\n[1]Most founders who get contacted by corp dev already know what it\nmeans.  And yet even when they know what corp dev does and know\nthey don't want to sell, they take the meeting.  Why do they do it?\nThe same mix of denial and wishful thinking that underlies most\nmistakes founders make. It's flattering to talk to someone who wants\nto buy you.  And who knows, maybe their offer will be surprisingly\nhigh.  You should at least see what it is, right?No.  If they were going to send you an offer immediately by email,\nsure, you might as well open it.  But that is not how conversations\nwith corp dev work.  If you get an offer at all, it will be at the\nend of a long and unbelievably distracting process.  And if the\noffer is surprising, it will be surprisingly low.Distractions are the thing you can least afford in a startup.  And\nconversations with corp dev are the worst sort of distraction,\nbecause as well as consuming your attention they undermine your\nmorale.  One of the tricks to surviving a grueling process is not\nto stop and think how tired you are.  Instead you get into a sort\nof flow. \n[2]\nImagine what it would do to you if at mile 20 of a\nmarathon, someone ran up beside you and said \"You must feel really\ntired.  Would you like to stop and take a rest?\"  Conversations\nwith corp dev are like that but worse, because the suggestion of\nstopping gets combined in your mind with the imaginary high price\nyou think they'll offer.And then you're really in trouble.  If they can, corp dev people\nlike to turn the tables on you. They like to get you to the point\nwhere you're trying to convince them to buy instead of them trying\nto convince you to sell.  And surprisingly often they succeed.This is a very slippery slope, greased with some of the most powerful\nforces that can work on founders' minds, and attended by an experienced\nprofessional whose full time job is to push you down it.Their tactics in pushing you down that slope are usually fairly\nbrutal. Corp dev people's whole job is to buy companies, and they\ndon't even get to choose which.  The only way their performance is\nmeasured is by how cheaply they can buy you, and the more ambitious\nones will stop at nothing to achieve that. For example, they'll\nalmost always start with a lowball offer, just to see if you'll\ntake it. Even if you don't, a low initial offer will demoralize you\nand make you easier to manipulate.And that is the most innocent of their tactics. Just wait till\nyou've agreed on a price and think you have a done deal, and then\nthey come back and say their boss has vetoed the deal and won't do\nit for more than half the agreed upon price. Happens all the time.\nIf you think investors can behave badly, it's nothing compared to\nwhat corp dev people can do.  Even corp dev people at companies\nthat are otherwise benevolent.I remember once complaining to a\nfriend at Google about some nasty trick their corp dev people had\npulled on a YC startup.\"What happened to Don't be Evil?\" I asked.\"I don't think corp dev got the memo,\" he replied.The tactics you encounter in M&A conversations can be like nothing\nyou've experienced in the otherwise comparatively \nupstanding world\nof Silicon Valley.  It's as if a chunk of genetic material from the\nold-fashioned robber baron business world got incorporated into the\nstartup world.\n[3]The simplest way to protect yourself is to use the trick that John\nD. Rockefeller, whose grandfather was an alcoholic, used to protect\nhimself from becoming one.  He once told a Sunday school class\n\n  Boys, do you know why I never became a drunkard?  Because I never\n  took the first drink.\n\nDo you want to sell your company right now?  Not eventually, right\nnow.  If not, just don't take the first meeting.  They won't be\noffended.  And you in turn will be guaranteed to be spared one of\nthe worst experiences that can happen to a startup.If you do want to sell, there's another set of \ntechniques\n for doing\nthat.  But the biggest mistake founders make in dealing with corp\ndev is not doing a bad job of talking to them when they're ready\nto, but talking to them before they are.  So if you remember only\nthe title of this essay, you already know most of what you need to\nknow about M&A in the first year.Notes[1]\nI'm not saying you should never sell.  I'm saying you should\nbe clear in your own mind about whether you want to sell or not,\nand not be led by manipulation or wishful thinking into trying to\nsell earlier than you otherwise would have.[2]\nIn a startup, as in most competitive sports, the task at hand\nalmost does this for you; you're too busy to feel tired.  But when\nyou lose that protection, e.g. at the final whistle, the fatigue\nhits you like a wave.  To talk to corp dev is to let yourself feel\nit mid-game.[3]\nTo be fair, the apparent misdeeds of corp dev people are magnified\nby the fact that they function as the face of a large organization\nthat often doesn't know its own mind.  Acquirers can be surprisingly\nindecisive about acquisitions, and their flakiness is indistinguishable\nfrom dishonesty by the time it filters down to you.Thanks to Marc Andreessen, Jessica Livingston, Geoff\nRalston, and Qasar Younis for reading drafts of this.September 2007In high school I decided I was going to study philosophy in college.\nI had several motives, some more honorable than others.  One of the\nless honorable was to shock people.  College was regarded as job\ntraining where I grew up, so studying philosophy seemed an impressively\nimpractical thing to do.  Sort of like slashing holes in your clothes\nor putting a safety pin through your ear, which were other forms\nof impressive impracticality then just coming into fashion.But I had some more honest motives as well.  I thought studying\nphilosophy would be a shortcut straight to wisdom.  All the people\nmajoring in other things would just end up with a bunch of domain\nknowledge.  I would be learning what was really what.I'd tried to read a few philosophy books.  Not recent ones; you\nwouldn't find those in our high school library.  But I tried to\nread Plato and Aristotle.  I doubt I believed I understood them,\nbut they sounded like they were talking about something important.\nI assumed I'd learn what in college.The summer before senior year I took some college classes.  I learned\na lot in the calculus class, but I didn't learn much in Philosophy\n101.  And yet my plan to study philosophy remained intact.  It was\nmy fault I hadn't learned anything.  I hadn't read the books we\nwere assigned carefully enough.  I'd give Berkeley's Principles\nof Human Knowledge another shot in college.  Anything so admired\nand so difficult to read must have something in it, if one could\nonly figure out what.Twenty-six years later, I still don't understand Berkeley.  I have\na nice edition of his collected works.  Will I ever read it?  Seems\nunlikely.The difference between then and now is that now I understand why\nBerkeley is probably not worth trying to understand.  I think I see\nnow what went wrong with philosophy, and how we might fix it.WordsI did end up being a philosophy major for most of college.  It\ndidn't work out as I'd hoped.  I didn't learn any magical truths\ncompared to which everything else was mere domain knowledge.  But\nI do at least know now why I didn't.  Philosophy doesn't really\nhave a subject matter in the way math or history or most other\nuniversity subjects do.  There is no core of knowledge one must\nmaster.  The closest you come to that is a knowledge of what various\nindividual philosophers have said about different topics over the\nyears.  Few were sufficiently correct that people have forgotten\nwho discovered what they discovered.Formal logic has some subject matter. I took several classes in\nlogic.  I don't know if I learned anything from them.\n[1]\nIt does seem to me very important to be able to flip ideas around in\none's head: to see when two ideas don't fully cover the space of\npossibilities, or when one idea is the same as another but with a\ncouple things changed.  But did studying logic teach me the importance\nof thinking this way, or make me any better at it?  I don't know.There are things I know I learned from studying philosophy.  The\nmost dramatic I learned immediately, in the first semester of\nfreshman year, in a class taught by Sydney Shoemaker.  I learned\nthat I don't exist.  I am (and you are) a collection of cells that\nlurches around driven by various forces, and calls itself I.  But\nthere's no central, indivisible thing that your identity goes with.\nYou could conceivably lose half your brain and live.  Which means\nyour brain could conceivably be split into two halves and each\ntransplanted into different bodies.  Imagine waking up after such\nan operation.  You have to imagine being two people.The real lesson here is that the concepts we use in everyday life\nare fuzzy, and break down if pushed too hard.  Even a concept as\ndear to us as I.  It took me a while to grasp this, but when I\ndid it was fairly sudden, like someone in the nineteenth century\ngrasping evolution and realizing the story of creation they'd been\ntold as a child was all wrong. \n[2]\nOutside of math there's a limit\nto how far you can push words; in fact, it would not be a bad\ndefinition of math to call it the study of terms that have precise\nmeanings.  Everyday words are inherently imprecise.  They work well\nenough in everyday life that you don't notice.  Words seem to work,\njust as Newtonian physics seems to.  But you can always make them\nbreak if you push them far enough.I would say that this has been, unfortunately for philosophy, the\ncentral fact of philosophy.  Most philosophical debates are not\nmerely afflicted by but driven by confusions over words.  Do we\nhave free will?  Depends what you mean by \"free.\" Do abstract ideas\nexist?  Depends what you mean by \"exist.\"Wittgenstein is popularly credited with the idea that most philosophical\ncontroversies are due to confusions over language.  I'm not sure\nhow much credit to give him.  I suspect a lot of people realized\nthis, but reacted simply by not studying philosophy, rather than\nbecoming philosophy professors.How did things get this way?  Can something people have spent\nthousands of years studying really be a waste of time?  Those are\ninteresting questions.  In fact, some of the most interesting\nquestions you can ask about philosophy.  The most valuable way to\napproach the current philosophical tradition may be neither to get\nlost in pointless speculations like Berkeley, nor to shut them down\nlike Wittgenstein, but to study it as an example of reason gone\nwrong.HistoryWestern philosophy really begins with Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle.\nWhat we know of their predecessors comes from fragments and references\nin later works; their doctrines could be described as speculative\ncosmology that occasionally strays into analysis.  Presumably they\nwere driven by whatever makes people in every other society invent\ncosmologies.\n[3]With Socrates, Plato, and particularly Aristotle, this tradition\nturned a corner.  There started to be a lot more analysis.  I suspect\nPlato and Aristotle were encouraged in this by progress in math.\nMathematicians had by then shown that you could figure things out\nin a much more conclusive way than by making up fine sounding stories\nabout them.  \n[4]People talk so much about abstractions now that we don't realize\nwhat a leap it must have been when they first started to.  It was\npresumably many thousands of years between when people first started\ndescribing things as hot or cold and when someone asked \"what is\nheat?\"  No doubt it was a very gradual process.  We don't know if\nPlato or Aristotle were the first to ask any of the questions they\ndid.  But their works are the oldest we have that do this on a large\nscale, and there is a freshness (not to say naivete) about them\nthat suggests some of the questions they asked were new to them,\nat least.Aristotle in particular reminds me of the phenomenon that happens\nwhen people discover something new, and are so excited by it that\nthey race through a huge percentage of the newly discovered territory\nin one lifetime.  If so, that's evidence of how new this kind of\nthinking was. \n[5]This is all to explain how Plato and Aristotle can be very impressive\nand yet naive and mistaken.  It was impressive even to ask the\nquestions they did.  That doesn't mean they always came up with\ngood answers.  It's not considered insulting to say that ancient\nGreek mathematicians were naive in some respects, or at least lacked\nsome concepts that would have made their lives easier.  So I hope\npeople will not be too offended if I propose that ancient philosophers\nwere similarly naive.  In particular, they don't seem to have fully\ngrasped what I earlier called the central fact of philosophy: that\nwords break if you push them too far.\"Much to the surprise of the builders of the first digital computers,\"\nRod Brooks wrote, \"programs written for them usually did not work.\"\n[6]\nSomething similar happened when people first started trying\nto talk about abstractions.  Much to their surprise, they didn't\narrive at answers they agreed upon.  In fact, they rarely seemed\nto arrive at answers at all.They were in effect arguing about artifacts induced by sampling at\ntoo low a resolution.The proof of how useless some of their answers turned out to be is\nhow little effect they have.  No one after reading Aristotle's\nMetaphysics does anything differently as a result.\n[7]Surely I'm not claiming that ideas have to have practical applications\nto be interesting?  No, they may not have to.  Hardy's boast that\nnumber theory had no use whatsoever wouldn't disqualify it.  But\nhe turned out to be mistaken.  In fact, it's suspiciously hard to\nfind a field of math that truly has no practical use.  And Aristotle's\nexplanation of the ultimate goal of philosophy in Book A of the\nMetaphysics implies that philosophy should be useful too.Theoretical KnowledgeAristotle's goal was to find the most general of general principles.\nThe examples he gives are convincing: an ordinary worker builds\nthings a certain way out of habit; a master craftsman can do more\nbecause he grasps the underlying principles.  The trend is clear:\nthe more general the knowledge, the more admirable it is.  But then\nhe makes a mistake\u2014possibly the most important mistake in the\nhistory of philosophy.  He has noticed that theoretical knowledge\nis often acquired for its own sake, out of curiosity, rather than\nfor any practical need.  So he proposes there are two kinds of\ntheoretical knowledge: some that's useful in practical matters and\nsome that isn't.  Since people interested in the latter are interested\nin it for its own sake, it must be more noble.  So he sets as his\ngoal in the Metaphysics the exploration of knowledge that has no\npractical use.  Which means no alarms go off when he takes on grand\nbut vaguely understood questions and ends up getting lost in a sea\nof words.His mistake was to confuse motive and result.  Certainly, people\nwho want a deep understanding of something are often driven by\ncuriosity rather than any practical need.  But that doesn't mean\nwhat they end up learning is useless.  It's very valuable in practice\nto have a deep understanding of what you're doing; even if you're\nnever called on to solve advanced problems, you can see shortcuts\nin the solution of simple ones, and your knowledge won't break down\nin edge cases, as it would if you were relying on formulas you\ndidn't understand.  Knowledge is power.  That's what makes theoretical\nknowledge prestigious.  It's also what causes smart people to be\ncurious about certain things and not others; our DNA is not so\ndisinterested as we might think.So while ideas don't have to have immediate practical applications\nto be interesting, the kinds of things we find interesting will\nsurprisingly often turn out to have practical applications.The reason Aristotle didn't get anywhere in the Metaphysics was\npartly that he set off with contradictory aims: to explore the most\nabstract ideas, guided by the assumption that they were useless.\nHe was like an explorer looking for a territory to the north of\nhim, starting with the assumption that it was located to the south.And since his work became the map used by generations of future\nexplorers, he sent them off in the wrong direction as well. \n[8]\nPerhaps worst of all, he protected them from both the criticism of\noutsiders and the promptings of their own inner compass by establishing\nthe principle that the most noble sort of theoretical knowledge had\nto be useless.The Metaphysics is mostly a failed experiment.  A few ideas from\nit turned out to be worth keeping; the bulk of it has had no effect\nat all.  The Metaphysics is among the least read of all famous\nbooks.  It's not hard to understand the way Newton's Principia\nis, but the way a garbled message is.Arguably it's an interesting failed experiment.  But unfortunately\nthat was not the conclusion Aristotle's successors derived from\nworks like the Metaphysics. \n[9]\nSoon after, the western world\nfell on intellectual hard times.  Instead of version 1s to be\nsuperseded, the works of Plato and Aristotle became revered texts\nto be mastered and discussed.  And so things remained for a shockingly\nlong time.  It was not till around 1600 (in Europe, where the center\nof gravity had shifted by then) that one found people confident\nenough to treat Aristotle's work as a catalog of mistakes.  And\neven then they rarely said so outright.If it seems surprising that the gap was so long, consider how little\nprogress there was in math between Hellenistic times and the\nRenaissance.In the intervening years an unfortunate idea took hold:  that it\nwas not only acceptable to produce works like the Metaphysics,\nbut that it was a particularly prestigious line of work, done by a\nclass of people called philosophers.  No one thought to go back and\ndebug Aristotle's motivating argument.  And so instead of correcting\nthe problem Aristotle discovered by falling into it\u2014that you can\neasily get lost if you talk too loosely about very abstract ideas\u2014they \ncontinued to fall into it.The SingularityCuriously, however, the works they produced continued to attract\nnew readers.  Traditional philosophy occupies a kind of singularity\nin this respect.  If you write in an unclear way about big ideas,\nyou produce something that seems tantalizingly attractive to\ninexperienced but intellectually ambitious students.  Till one knows\nbetter, it's hard to distinguish something that's hard to understand\nbecause the writer was unclear in his own mind from something like\na mathematical proof that's hard to understand because the ideas\nit represents are hard to understand.  To someone who hasn't learned\nthe difference, traditional philosophy seems extremely attractive:\nas hard (and therefore impressive) as math, yet broader in scope.\nThat was what lured me in as a high school student.This singularity is even more singular in having its own defense\nbuilt in.  When things are hard to understand, people who suspect\nthey're nonsense generally keep quiet.  There's no way to prove a\ntext is meaningless.  The closest you can get is to show that the\nofficial judges of some class of texts can't distinguish them from\nplacebos. \n[10]And so instead of denouncing philosophy, most people who suspected\nit was a waste of time just studied other things.  That alone is\nfairly damning evidence, considering philosophy's claims.  It's\nsupposed to be about the ultimate truths. Surely all smart people\nwould be interested in it, if it delivered on that promise.Because philosophy's flaws turned away the sort of people who might\nhave corrected them, they tended to be self-perpetuating.  Bertrand\nRussell wrote in a letter in 1912:\n\n  Hitherto the people attracted to philosophy have been mostly those\n  who loved the big generalizations, which were all wrong, so that\n  few people with exact minds have taken up the subject.\n[11]\n\nHis response was to launch Wittgenstein at it, with dramatic results.I think Wittgenstein deserves to be famous not for the discovery\nthat most previous philosophy was a waste of time, which judging\nfrom the circumstantial evidence must have been made by every smart\nperson who studied a little philosophy and declined to pursue it\nfurther, but for how he acted in response.\n[12]\nInstead of quietly\nswitching to another field, he made a fuss, from inside.  He was\nGorbachev.The field of philosophy is still shaken from the fright Wittgenstein\ngave it. \n[13]\nLater in life he spent a lot of time talking about\nhow words worked.  Since that seems to be allowed, that's what a\nlot of philosophers do now.  Meanwhile, sensing a vacuum in the\nmetaphysical speculation department, the people who used to do\nliterary criticism have been edging Kantward, under new names like\n\"literary theory,\" \"critical theory,\" and when they're feeling\nambitious, plain \"theory.\"  The writing is the familiar word salad:\n\n  Gender is not like some of the other grammatical modes which\n  express precisely a mode of conception without any reality that\n  corresponds to the conceptual mode, and consequently do not express\n  precisely something in reality by which the intellect could be\n  moved to conceive a thing the way it does, even where that motive\n  is not something in the thing as such.\n  [14]\n\nThe singularity I've described is not going away.  There's a market\nfor writing that sounds impressive and can't be disproven. There\nwill always be both supply and demand.  So if one group abandons\nthis territory, there will always be others ready to occupy it.A ProposalWe may be able to do better.  Here's an intriguing possibility.\nPerhaps we should do what Aristotle meant to do, instead of what\nhe did.  The goal he announces in the Metaphysics seems one worth\npursuing: to discover the most general truths.  That sounds good.\nBut instead of trying to discover them because they're useless,\nlet's try to discover them because they're useful.I propose we try again, but that we use that heretofore despised\ncriterion, applicability, as a guide to keep us from wondering\noff into a swamp of abstractions.  Instead of trying to answer the\nquestion:\n\n  What are the most general truths?\n\nlet's try to answer the question\n\n  Of all the useful things we can say, which are the most general?\n\nThe test of utility I propose is whether we cause people who read\nwhat we've written to do anything differently afterward.  Knowing\nwe have to give definite (if implicit) advice will keep us from\nstraying beyond the resolution of the words we're using.The goal is the same as Aristotle's; we just approach it from a\ndifferent direction.As an example of a useful, general idea, consider that of the\ncontrolled experiment.  There's an idea that has turned out to be\nwidely applicable.  Some might say it's part of science, but it's\nnot part of any specific science; it's literally meta-physics (in\nour sense of \"meta\").   The idea of evolution is another. It turns\nout to have quite broad applications\u2014for example, in genetic\nalgorithms and even product design.  Frankfurt's distinction between\nlying and bullshitting seems a promising recent example.\n[15]These seem to me what philosophy should look like: quite general\nobservations that would cause someone who understood them to do\nsomething differently.Such observations will necessarily be about things that are imprecisely\ndefined.  Once you start using words with precise meanings, you're\ndoing math.  So starting from utility won't entirely solve the\nproblem I described above\u2014it won't flush out the metaphysical\nsingularity.  But it should help.  It gives people with good\nintentions a new roadmap into abstraction.  And they may thereby\nproduce things that make the writing of the people with bad intentions\nlook bad by comparison.One drawback of this approach is that it won't produce the sort of\nwriting that gets you tenure.  And not just because it's not currently\nthe fashion.  In order to get tenure in any field you must not\narrive at conclusions that members of tenure committees can disagree\nwith.  In practice there are two kinds of solutions to this problem.\nIn math and the sciences, you can prove what you're saying, or at\nany rate adjust your conclusions so you're not claiming anything\nfalse (\"6 of 8 subjects had lower blood pressure after the treatment\").\nIn the humanities you can either avoid drawing any definite conclusions\n(e.g. conclude that an issue is a complex one), or draw conclusions\nso narrow that no one cares enough to disagree with you.The kind of philosophy I'm advocating won't be able to take either\nof these routes.  At best you'll be able to achieve the essayist's\nstandard of proof, not the mathematician's or the experimentalist's.\nAnd yet you won't be able to meet the usefulness test without\nimplying definite and fairly broadly applicable conclusions.  Worse\nstill, the usefulness test will tend to produce results that annoy\npeople: there's no use in telling people things they already believe,\nand people are often upset to be told things they don't.Here's the exciting thing, though.  Anyone can do this.  Getting\nto general plus useful by starting with useful and cranking up the\ngenerality may be unsuitable for junior professors trying to get\ntenure, but it's better for everyone else, including professors who\nalready have it.  This side of the mountain is a nice gradual slope.\nYou can start by writing things that are useful but very specific,\nand then gradually make them more general.  Joe's has good burritos.\nWhat makes a good burrito?  What makes good food?  What makes\nanything good?  You can take as long as you want.  You don't have\nto get all the way to the top of the mountain.  You don't have to\ntell anyone you're doing philosophy.If it seems like a daunting task to do philosophy, here's an\nencouraging thought.  The field is a lot younger than it seems.\nThough the first philosophers in the western tradition lived about\n2500 years ago, it would be misleading to say the field is 2500\nyears old, because for most of that time the leading practitioners\nweren't doing much more than writing commentaries on Plato or\nAristotle while watching over their shoulders for the next invading\narmy.  In the times when they weren't, philosophy was hopelessly\nintermingled with religion.  It didn't shake itself free till a\ncouple hundred years ago, and even then was afflicted by the\nstructural problems I've described above.  If I say this, some will\nsay it's a ridiculously overbroad and uncharitable generalization,\nand others will say it's old news, but here goes: judging from their\nworks, most philosophers up to the present have been wasting their\ntime.  So in a sense the field is still at the first step. \n[16]That sounds a preposterous claim to make.  It won't seem so\npreposterous in 10,000 years.  Civilization always seems old, because\nit's always the oldest it's ever been.  The only way to say whether\nsomething is really old or not is by looking at structural evidence,\nand structurally philosophy is young; it's still reeling from the\nunexpected breakdown of words.Philosophy is as young now as math was in 1500.  There is a lot\nmore to discover.Notes\n[1]\nIn practice formal logic is not much use, because despite\nsome progress in the last 150 years we're still only able to formalize\na small percentage of statements.  We may never do that much better,\nfor the same reason 1980s-style \"knowledge representation\" could\nnever have worked; many statements may have no representation more\nconcise than a huge, analog brain state.[2]\nIt was harder for Darwin's contemporaries to grasp this than\nwe can easily imagine.  The story of creation in the Bible is not\njust a Judeo-Christian concept; it's roughly what everyone must\nhave believed since before people were people.  The hard part of\ngrasping evolution was to realize that species weren't, as they\nseem to be, unchanging, but had instead evolved from different,\nsimpler organisms over unimaginably long periods of time.Now we don't have to make that leap.  No one in an industrialized\ncountry encounters the idea of evolution for the first time as an\nadult.  Everyone's taught about it as a child, either as truth or\nheresy.[3]\nGreek philosophers before Plato wrote in verse.  This must\nhave affected what they said.  If you try to write about the nature\nof the world in verse, it inevitably turns into incantation.  Prose\nlets you be more precise, and more tentative.[4]\nPhilosophy is like math's\nne'er-do-well brother.  It was born when Plato and Aristotle looked\nat the works of their predecessors and said in effect \"why can't\nyou be more like your brother?\"  Russell was still saying the same\nthing 2300 years later.Math is the precise half of the most abstract ideas, and philosophy\nthe imprecise half.  It's probably inevitable that philosophy will\nsuffer by comparison, because there's no lower bound to its precision.\nBad math is merely boring, whereas bad philosophy is nonsense.  And\nyet there are some good ideas in the imprecise half.[5]\nAristotle's best work was in logic and zoology, both of which\nhe can  be said to have invented.  But the most dramatic departure\nfrom his predecessors was a new, much more analytical style of\nthinking.  He was arguably the first scientist.[6]\nBrooks, Rodney, Programming in Common Lisp, Wiley, 1985, p.\n94.[7]\nSome would say we depend on Aristotle more than we realize,\nbecause his ideas were one of the ingredients in our common culture.\nCertainly a lot of the words we use have a connection with Aristotle,\nbut it seems a bit much to suggest that we wouldn't have the concept\nof the essence of something or the distinction between matter and\nform if Aristotle hadn't written about them.One way to see how much we really depend on Aristotle would be to\ndiff European culture with Chinese: what ideas did European culture\nhave in 1800 that Chinese culture didn't, in virtue of Aristotle's\ncontribution?[8]\nThe meaning of the word \"philosophy\" has changed over time.\nIn ancient times it covered a broad range of topics, comparable in\nscope to our \"scholarship\" (though without the methodological\nimplications).  Even as late as Newton's time it included what we\nnow call \"science.\"  But core of the subject today is still what\nseemed to Aristotle the core: the attempt to discover the most\ngeneral truths.Aristotle didn't call this \"metaphysics.\"  That name got assigned\nto it because the books we now call the Metaphysics came after\n(meta = after) the Physics in the standard edition of Aristotle's\nworks compiled by Andronicus of Rhodes three centuries later.  What\nwe call \"metaphysics\" Aristotle called \"first philosophy.\"[9]\nSome of Aristotle's immediate successors may have realized\nthis, but it's hard to say because most of their works are lost.[10]\nSokal, Alan, \"Transgressing the Boundaries: Toward a Transformative\nHermeneutics of Quantum Gravity,\" Social Text 46/47, pp. 217-252.Abstract-sounding nonsense seems to be most attractive when it's\naligned with some axe the audience already has to grind.  If this\nis so we should find it's most popular with groups that are (or\nfeel) weak.  The powerful don't need its reassurance.[11]\nLetter to Ottoline Morrell, December 1912.  Quoted in:Monk, Ray, Ludwig Wittgenstein: The Duty of Genius, Penguin, 1991,\np. 75.[12]\nA preliminary result, that all metaphysics between Aristotle\nand 1783 had been a waste of time, is due to I. Kant.[13]\nWittgenstein asserted a sort of mastery to which the inhabitants\nof early 20th century Cambridge seem to have been peculiarly\nvulnerable\u2014perhaps partly because so many had been raised religious\nand then stopped believing, so had a vacant space in their heads\nfor someone to tell them what to do (others chose Marx or Cardinal\nNewman), and partly because a quiet, earnest place like Cambridge\nin that era had no natural immunity to messianic figures, just as\nEuropean politics then had no natural immunity to dictators.[14]\nThis is actually from the Ordinatio of Duns Scotus (ca.\n1300), with \"number\" replaced by \"gender.\"  Plus ca change.Wolter, Allan (trans), Duns Scotus: Philosophical Writings, Nelson,\n1963, p. 92.[15]\nFrankfurt, Harry, On Bullshit,  Princeton University Press,\n2005.[16]\nSome introductions to philosophy now take the line that\nphilosophy is worth studying as a process rather than for any\nparticular truths you'll learn.  The philosophers whose works they\ncover would be rolling in their graves at that.  They hoped they\nwere doing more than serving as examples of how to argue: they hoped\nthey were getting results.  Most were wrong, but it doesn't seem\nan impossible hope.This argument seems to me like someone in 1500 looking at the lack\nof results achieved by alchemy and saying its value was as a process.\nNo, they were going about it wrong.  It turns out it is possible\nto transmute lead into gold (though not economically at current\nenergy prices), but the route to that knowledge was to\nbacktrack and try another approach.Thanks to Trevor Blackwell, Paul Buchheit, Jessica Livingston, \nRobert Morris, Mark Nitzberg, and Peter Norvig for reading drafts of this.January 2003(This article is derived from a keynote talk at the fall 2002 meeting\nof NEPLS.)Visitors to this country are often surprised to find that\nAmericans like to begin a conversation by asking \"what do you do?\"\nI've never liked this question.  I've rarely had a\nneat answer to it.  But I think I have finally solved the problem.\nNow, when someone asks me what I do, I look them straight\nin the eye and say \"I'm designing a \nnew dialect of Lisp.\"   \nI recommend this answer to anyone who doesn't like being asked what\nthey do.  The conversation will turn immediately to other topics.I don't consider myself to be doing research on programming languages.\nI'm just designing one, in the same way that someone might design\na building or a chair or a new typeface.\nI'm not trying to discover anything new.  I just want\nto make a language that will be good to program in.  In some ways,\nthis assumption makes life a lot easier.The difference between design and research seems to be a question\nof new versus good.  Design doesn't have to be new, but it has to  \nbe good.  Research doesn't have to be good, but it has to be new.\nI think these two paths converge at the top: the best design\nsurpasses its predecessors by using new ideas, and the best research\nsolves problems that are not only new, but actually worth solving.\nSo ultimately we're aiming for the same destination, just approaching\nit from different directions.What I'm going to talk about today is what your target looks like\nfrom the back.  What do you do differently when you treat\nprogramming languages as a design problem instead of a research topic?The biggest difference is that you focus more on the user.\nDesign begins by asking, who is this\nfor and what do they need from it?  A good architect,\nfor example, does not begin by creating a design that he then\nimposes on the users, but by studying the intended users and figuring\nout what they need.Notice I said \"what they need,\" not \"what they want.\"  I don't mean\nto give the impression that working as a designer means working as \na sort of short-order cook, making whatever the client tells you\nto.  This varies from field to field in the arts, but\nI don't think there is any field in which the best work is done by\nthe people who just make exactly what the customers tell them to.The customer is always right in\nthe sense that the measure of good design is how well it works\nfor the user.  If you make a novel that bores everyone, or a chair\nthat's horribly uncomfortable to sit in, then you've done a bad\njob, period.  It's no defense to say that the novel or the chair  \nis designed according to the most advanced theoretical principles.And yet, making what works for the user doesn't mean simply making\nwhat the user tells you to.  Users don't know what all the choices\nare, and are often mistaken about what they really want.The answer to the paradox, I think, is that you have to design\nfor the user, but you have to design what the user needs, not simply  \nwhat he says he wants.\nIt's much like being a doctor.  You can't just treat a patient's\nsymptoms.  When a patient tells you his symptoms, you have to figure\nout what's actually wrong with him, and treat that.This focus on the user is a kind of axiom from which most of the\npractice of good design can be derived, and around which most design\nissues center.If good design must do what the user needs, who is the user?  When\nI say that design must be for users, I don't mean to imply that good \ndesign aims at some kind of  \nlowest common denominator.  You can pick any group of users you\nwant.  If you're designing a tool, for example, you can design it\nfor anyone from beginners to experts, and what's good design\nfor one group might be bad for another.  The point\nis, you have to pick some group of users.  I don't think you can\neven talk about good or bad design except with\nreference to some intended user.You're most likely to get good design if the intended users include\nthe designer himself.  When you design something\nfor a group that doesn't include you, it tends to be for people\nyou consider to be less sophisticated than you, not more sophisticated.That's a problem, because looking down on the user, however benevolently,\nseems inevitably to corrupt the designer.\nI suspect that very few housing\nprojects in the US were designed by architects who expected to live\nin them.   You can see the same thing\nin programming languages.  C, Lisp, and Smalltalk were created for\ntheir own designers to use.  Cobol, Ada, and Java, were created   \nfor other people to use.If you think you're designing something for idiots, the odds are\nthat you're not designing something good, even for idiots.\nEven if you're designing something for the most sophisticated\nusers, though, you're still designing for humans.  It's different \nin research.  In math you\ndon't choose abstractions because they're\neasy for humans to understand; you choose whichever make the\nproof shorter.  I think this is true for the sciences generally.\nScientific ideas are not meant to be ergonomic.Over in the arts, things are very different.  Design is\nall about people.  The human body is a strange\nthing, but when you're designing a chair,\nthat's what you're designing for, and there's no way around it.\nAll the arts have to pander to the interests and limitations\nof humans.   In painting, for example, all other things being\nequal a painting with people in it will be more interesting than\none without.  It is not merely an accident of history that\nthe great paintings of the Renaissance are all full of people.\nIf they hadn't been, painting as a medium wouldn't have the prestige\nthat it does.Like it or not, programming languages are also for people,\nand I suspect the human brain is just as lumpy and idiosyncratic\nas the human body.  Some ideas are easy for people to grasp\nand some aren't.  For example, we seem to have a very limited\ncapacity for dealing with detail.  It's this fact that makes\nprograming languages a good idea in the first place; if we\ncould handle the detail, we could just program in machine\nlanguage.Remember, too, that languages are not\nprimarily a form for finished programs, but something that\nprograms have to be developed in.  Anyone in the arts could\ntell you that you might want different mediums for the\ntwo situations.  Marble, for example, is a nice, durable\nmedium for finished ideas, but a hopelessly inflexible one\nfor developing new ideas.A program, like a proof,\nis a pruned version of a tree that in the past has had\nfalse starts branching off all over it.  So the test of\na language is not simply how clean the finished program looks\nin it, but how clean the path to the finished program was.\nA design choice that gives you elegant finished programs\nmay not give you an elegant design process.  For example, \nI've written a few macro-defining macros full of nested\nbackquotes that look now like little gems, but writing them\ntook hours of the ugliest trial and error, and frankly, I'm still\nnot entirely sure they're correct.We often act as if the test of a language were how good\nfinished programs look in it.\nIt seems so convincing when you see the same program\nwritten in two languages, and one version is much shorter.\nWhen you approach the problem from the direction of the\narts, you're less likely to depend on this sort of\ntest.  You don't want to end up with a programming\nlanguage like marble.For example, it is a huge win in developing software to\nhave an interactive toplevel, what in Lisp is called a\nread-eval-print loop.  And when you have one this has\nreal effects on the design of the language.  It would not\nwork well for a language where you have to declare\nvariables before using them, for example.  When you're\njust typing expressions into the toplevel, you want to be \nable to set x to some value and then start doing things\nto x.  You don't want to have to declare the type of x\nfirst.  You may dispute either of the premises, but if\na language has to have a toplevel to be convenient, and\nmandatory type declarations are incompatible with a\ntoplevel, then no language that makes type declarations  \nmandatory could be convenient to program in.In practice, to get good design you have to get close, and stay\nclose, to your users.  You have to calibrate your ideas on actual\nusers constantly, especially in the beginning.  One of the reasons\nJane Austen's novels are so good is that she read them out loud to\nher family.  That's why she never sinks into self-indulgently arty\ndescriptions of landscapes,\nor pretentious philosophizing.  (The philosophy's there, but it's\nwoven into the story instead of being pasted onto it like a label.)\nIf you open an average \"literary\" novel and imagine reading it out loud\nto your friends as something you'd written, you'll feel all too\nkeenly what an imposition that kind of thing is upon the reader.In the software world, this idea is known as Worse is Better.\nActually, there are several ideas mixed together in the concept of\nWorse is Better, which is why people are still arguing about\nwhether worse\nis actually better or not.  But one of the main ideas in that\nmix is that if you're building something new, you should get a\nprototype in front of users as soon as possible.The alternative approach might be called the Hail Mary strategy.\nInstead of getting a prototype out quickly and gradually refining\nit, you try to create the complete, finished, product in one long\ntouchdown pass.  As far as I know, this is a\nrecipe for disaster.  Countless startups destroyed themselves this\nway during the Internet bubble.  I've never heard of a case\nwhere it worked.What people outside the software world may not realize is that\nWorse is Better is found throughout the arts.\nIn drawing, for example, the idea was discovered during the\nRenaissance.  Now almost every drawing teacher will tell you that\nthe right way to get an accurate drawing is not to\nwork your way slowly around the contour of an object, because errors will\naccumulate and you'll find at the end that the lines don't meet.\nInstead you should draw a few quick lines in roughly the right place,\nand then gradually refine this initial sketch.In most fields, prototypes\nhave traditionally been made out of different materials.\nTypefaces to be cut in metal were initially designed  \nwith a brush on paper.  Statues to be cast in bronze   \nwere modelled in wax.  Patterns to be embroidered on tapestries\nwere drawn on paper with ink wash.  Buildings to be\nconstructed from stone were tested on a smaller scale in wood.What made oil paint so exciting, when it\nfirst became popular in the fifteenth century, was that you\ncould actually make the finished work from the prototype.\nYou could make a preliminary drawing if you wanted to, but you\nweren't held to it; you could work out all the details, and\neven make major changes, as you finished the painting.You can do this in software too.  A prototype doesn't have to\nbe just a model; you can refine it into the finished product.\nI think you should always do this when you can.  It lets you\ntake advantage of new insights you have along the way.  But\nperhaps even more important, it's good for morale.Morale is key in design.  I'm surprised people\ndon't talk more about it.  One of my first\ndrawing teachers told me: if you're bored when you're\ndrawing something, the drawing will look boring.\nFor example, suppose you have to draw a building, and you\ndecide to draw each brick individually.  You can do this\nif you want, but if you get bored halfway through and start\nmaking the bricks mechanically instead of observing each one,   \nthe drawing will look worse than if you had merely suggested\nthe bricks.Building something by gradually refining a prototype is good\nfor morale because it keeps you engaged.  In software, my  \nrule is: always have working code.  If you're writing\nsomething that you'll be able to test in an hour, then you\nhave the prospect of an immediate reward to motivate you.\nThe same is true in the arts, and particularly in oil painting.\nMost painters start with a blurry sketch and gradually\nrefine it.\nIf you work this way, then in principle\nyou never have to end the day with something that actually\nlooks unfinished.  Indeed, there is even a saying among\npainters: \"A painting is never finished, you just stop\nworking on it.\"  This idea will be familiar to anyone who\nhas worked on software.Morale is another reason that it's hard to design something\nfor an unsophisticated user.   It's hard to stay interested in\nsomething you don't like yourself.  To make something  \ngood, you have to be thinking, \"wow, this is really great,\"\nnot \"what a piece of shit; those fools will love it.\"Design means making things for humans.  But it's not just the\nuser who's human.  The designer is human too.Notice all this time I've been talking about \"the designer.\"\nDesign usually has to be under the control of a single person to\nbe any good.   And yet it seems to be possible for several people\nto collaborate on a research project.  This seems to\nme one of the most interesting differences between research and\ndesign.There have been famous instances of collaboration in the arts,\nbut most of them seem to have been cases of molecular bonding rather\nthan nuclear fusion.  In an opera it's common for one person to\nwrite the libretto and another to write the music.   And during the Renaissance, \njourneymen from northern\nEurope were often employed to do the landscapes in the\nbackgrounds of Italian paintings.  But these aren't true collaborations.\nThey're more like examples of Robert Frost's\n\"good fences make good neighbors.\"  You can stick instances\nof good design together, but within each individual project,\none person has to be in control.I'm not saying that good design requires that one person think\nof everything.  There's nothing more valuable than the advice\nof someone whose judgement you trust.  But after the talking is\ndone, the decision about what to do has to rest with one person.Why is it that research can be done by collaborators and  \ndesign can't?  This is an interesting question.  I don't \nknow the answer.  Perhaps,\nif design and research converge, the best research is also\ngood design, and in fact can't be done by collaborators.\nA lot of the most famous scientists seem to have worked alone.\nBut I don't know enough to say whether there\nis a pattern here.  It could be simply that many famous scientists\nworked when collaboration was less common.Whatever the story is in the sciences, true collaboration\nseems to be vanishingly rare in the arts.  Design by committee is a\nsynonym for bad design.  Why is that so?  Is there some way to\nbeat this limitation?I'm inclined to think there isn't-- that good design requires\na dictator.  One reason is that good design has to   \nbe all of a piece.  Design is not just for humans, but\nfor individual humans.  If a design represents an idea that  \nfits in one person's head, then the idea will fit in the user's\nhead too.Related:November 2021(This essay is derived from a talk at the Cambridge Union.)When I was a kid, I'd have said there wasn't. My father told me so.\nSome people like some things, and other people like other things,\nand who's to say who's right?It seemed so obvious that there was no such thing as good taste\nthat it was only through indirect evidence that I realized my father\nwas wrong. And that's what I'm going to give you here: a proof by\nreductio ad absurdum. If we start from the premise that there's no\nsuch thing as good taste, we end up with conclusions that are\nobviously false, and therefore the premise must be wrong.We'd better start by saying what good taste is. There's a narrow\nsense in which it refers to aesthetic judgements and a broader one\nin which it refers to preferences of any kind. The strongest proof\nwould be to show that taste exists in the narrowest sense, so I'm\ngoing to talk about taste in art. You have better taste than me if\nthe art you like is better than the art I like.If there's no such thing as good taste, then there's no such thing\nas good art. Because if there is such a\nthing as good art, it's\neasy to tell which of two people has better taste. Show them a lot\nof works by artists they've never seen before and ask them to\nchoose the best, and whoever chooses the better art has better\ntaste.So if you want to discard the concept of good taste, you also have\nto discard the concept of good art. And that means you have to\ndiscard the possibility of people being good at making it. Which\nmeans there's no way for artists to be good at their jobs. And not\njust visual artists, but anyone who is in any sense an artist. You\ncan't have good actors, or novelists, or composers, or dancers\neither. You can have popular novelists, but not good ones.We don't realize how far we'd have to go if we discarded the concept\nof good taste, because we don't even debate the most obvious cases.\nBut it doesn't just mean we can't say which of two famous painters\nis better. It means we can't say that any painter is better than a\nrandomly chosen eight year old.That was how I realized my father was wrong. I started studying\npainting. And it was just like other kinds of work I'd done: you\ncould do it well, or badly, and if you tried hard, you could get\nbetter at it. And it was obvious that Leonardo and Bellini were\nmuch better at it\n\nRead the document and answer: What is the best thing to do in San Francisco?
